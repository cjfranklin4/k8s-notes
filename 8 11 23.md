# Lab 43 - Bind Mounts and Volume Mounts

Imagine you have a terrific Flask application that will help you create a mailing list for your company. You are able to run this application inside a container. You go through the process of entering all your email addresses into your database, and then you stop the Flask server/container. And your data is lost forever, because the container itself does not persist.

Obviously, this is not practical and would defeat the purpose of containerizing a lot of applications. What good is data management if the data disappears after you manage it? **We implement something called a mount, or a storage area within your local machine that is available to your container, which allows us to persist data (or for data to persist) once a container no longer exists.**

Any modifications you make to the storage space outside of the container will reflect within it, and vice versa. I**n programming, we often refer to "portals**" (sometimes even enthusiastically calling them "magic portals") through which things get passed. **You can think of mounts in this way: a portal between our container and our local machine.** 
## Bind Mounts vs. Volume Mounts

Bind mounting and volume mounting are similar conceptually. **Volume mounts are more flexible and have more features** (and, incidentally, are more recommended by Docker); **Docker manages Volumes**, which are usually not affected by other processes that happen to be running on the same host.

**Bind mounts will also mount a file or directory to your container from a host machine, but is not managed by docker**. You can change the host filesystem through processes running in a container, like creating, modifying, and deleting system files and directories, which sounds appropriately risky.

We establish these mounts from the command line using either a `-v` or a `--mount `flag. **Docker seems to prefer `--mount`,** especially when getting started; this flag is more verbose and you can specify more options than with `-v.` 

- lets create a flask app, that takes in emails and saves them to a database
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for
import sqlite3

app = Flask(__name__)

# SQLite database initialization
def get_db_connection():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('emails.db')
    conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
    return conn

def create_table():
    conn = get_db_connection()
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS subscribers (email text)''')
    conn.commit()
    c.close()
    conn.close()

def get_subscribers():
    conn = get_db_connection()
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute("SELECT * FROM subscribers")
    subscribers = c.fetchall()
    c.close()
    conn.close()
    return subscribers

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        email = request.form['email']
        if email:
            # Insert email into the database
            conn = get_db_connection()
            c = conn.cursor()
            c.execute("INSERT INTO subscribers VALUES (?)", (email,))
            conn.commit()
            c.close()
            conn.close()
            return redirect(url_for('index'))

# Get the list of current subscribers
    subscribers = get_subscribers()

    return render_template('index.html', subscribers=subscribers)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    create_table()
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=2224
    )
```
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Email Registration</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Subscribe to our newsletter</h1>
    <form method="POST" action="/">
        <input type="email" name="email" required>
        <input type="submit" value="Subscribe">
    </form>

    <h2>Current Subscribers:</h2>
    <ul>
        {% for subscriber in subscribers %}
        <li>{{ subscriber['email'] }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

> So, now imagine that Flask server is running in a container. The database is created within the container when everything gets up and running. Then, when you stop the server, the container is done and goes away...taking your database with it. _Unless you create a mount to a source outside of the container._

- Now, lets containerize this flask project inside Docker
```Dockerfile
# pulling our base image
FROM python:3.8-alpine   

# establishing the working directory within the container
WORKDIR /app

# copying from the local directory to the container working directory
COPY . .

# installing our requirements; we need to create this!
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# running our Flask server within the container
CMD ["python", "email_reg.py"]
```

- Lets build the image
```bash
docker build -t email-registration:v1.0 . 
```

- Then run the containaer WITHOUT A MOUNT
```bash
docker run -p 2224:5000 --name email-reg1 email-registration:v1.0
```

- Let's create a local file to mount to our container.
```bash
touch ~/mycode/email-registration/emails.db
```

- Create a <mark style="background: #ff9ed7;">bind mount</mark> with this command
- BIND MOUNTS - dev can choose the EXACT location where the db will be located
```bash
docker run -p 2224:5000 --name bind-mount --mount type=bind,source=/home/student/mycode/email-registration/emails.db,target=/app/emails.db email-registration:v1.0
```
- Let's break this command down. We probably know what's happenin up through the "`--moun`t" flag. 
- `_type_` is clearly telling Docker that his is a **bind mount**; 
- `_source_` is the **local file to be mounted** and <mark style="background: #ff9ed7;">needs an absolute path</mark>; 
- `_target_` **is the file in the container holding the data that needs to persist**; 
- and we also r**econgize our image for this containter at the end of the command**.
- Docker is telling the app to read and write from the source file, but the target file is there with `/app` to link to the source file


- Now, let's create a _volume_ mount. Do so with the following command:
- VOLUME MOUNT - docker chooses where emails.db will be located
```bash
docker run -p 2224:5000 --name mycont --mount type=volume,source=registered-emails,target=/app email-registration:v1.0
```
- With a volume mount, **we get to decide the name of the directory in which data will be stored locally**, **but not _where_.** Docker handles this. 
- The "source" here will be a directory created on your local host in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`. 
- Docker documentation seems to favor volume mounts, but there are cases to be made of being able store the persisted data where _you_ want, instead of where _Docker_ wants. 
- In this command above, **the entirety of the contents of `/app` within our container will be stored locally in** `/var/lib/docker/volumes/registered-emails/\_data`.

- Here you can inspect the volume mounted to your container, and below is the data you will receive
```bash
docker volume inspect registered-emails
```
```json
[                                                                                    
{                                                                                 
    "CreatedAt": "2023-05-16T16:49:44Z",                                         
    "Driver": "local",                                                          
    "Labels": null,                                                             
    "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/email-list/_data",                    
    "Name": "email-list",                                                       
    "Options": null,                                                           
    "Scope": "local"                                                             
}                                                                                                               
]   
```
- "`Mountpoint`" is a pretty clear key; **this is where the data from our container will persist**. Let's see our volume mount in real time. You'll need to have a few TMUX panes open for this. You should have your server running in one, and you'll need two others.

- In one TMUX pane, we will "watch" our volume. Because of the location within our posix directory structure, we have to use _sudo_ to gain root privileges. This will refresh itself every two second to show changes in this directory.
```bash
sudo watch ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/registered-emails/_data
```
```
Every 2.0s: ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/email-list/...  

Dockerfile
email_reg.py
emails.db
requirements.txt
templates
```

- Now lets move into your Docker container:
```bash
sudo docker exec -it mycont sh
```
- Let's break this command down a bit. 
- We know about `sudo` and `docker`. `exec` runs a new command in a running container. 
- The `-it` option is a combination of two separate options: `-i` or `--interactive `keeps STDIN open even if not attached, allowing you to interact with the container's input; 
- `-t` or `--tty` allocates a pseudo-TTY, which provides an interactive terminal session. `mycont` is the name we assigned to our container; 
- we could also access it by ID. 
- `sh` moves us into a "shell" within the container.

- Check out your server in your aux1. Did your data persist? It should have since you're using the same volume to mount to the container. **_If data exists in the volume when it's mounted, it overrides the data in the container's directory to which it is mounted_.**

- You can **remove Docker volumes** with the command
```bash
docker system prune --volumes
```

- You can **view/inspect the current volumes** you have created with the command
```bash
docker volume ls


docker volume inspect VOLUME_NAME
```
# Lab 46 - Writing Python Unit test
Just like security, testing is something that we often "forget" about. However, when you develop code, you should also be developing tests to run against your functions.

**Unit testing** in Python involves writing small, focused tests that verify the correct behavior of individual units of code, such as functions or methods. These tests are typically written using a testing framework like **`pytest`**, and can be automated and run regularly to ensure changes to the codebase do not introduce bugs or regressions.

Unit testing is important in Python because it allows developers to catch and fix bugs early in the development process, before they become more difficult and expensive to fix. We also want to make sure our code behaves the way we want and expect it to. Unit testing makes it easier to make changes and refactor the codebase without introducing unintended consequences.

To perform unit testing in Python, developers typically write test functions that involve _assertions_ in which they assert that the output is what is expected. Basically, "I claim that this is what my code will do. Prove me wrong." These tests are usually run automatically using a testing framework (such as pytest).

The standard tool for invoking tests is `pytest`. Where pytest will not write tests for you, it will run the tests you write against the functions you specify, and report back whether the test was a "pass" or "fail." Of course, failing a test indicates that the code may contain a bug. Better to catch bugs in testing than before it is rolled out to a production environment!

`pytest` bills itself as a "mature, full-featured Python testing tool that helps you write better programs". Sounds handy. You can read more at https://pytest.org.

## pytest/python commands
- `assert` - good way to test that the results of your code should be as expected
```python
x = 5

assert x < 10 #NO ERROR

assert x = 10
ERROR

####
assert "results of my code" == "the results that i need to have"
```

- functions with arguments/default values
```python
def example(adj="tiring")
	print(f"Python is {adj}")

example("Super Cool")
### OUTPUT ####
- Python is Awesome!

example()
### OUTPUT ####
- Python is tiring!
```

- Here is an example of python code we will run in the `pytest` environment
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""Alta3 Research | Building functions to test"""
# the homer function expects a word to be passed to it
# if it is not given one, it assumes the default "salad"
def homer(sd="salad"):
   return f"You don't win friends with {sd}"

# the milhouse function expects a word to be passed to it
# if it is not given one, it assumes the default "milhouse"
def milhouse(mh="milhouse"):
    return f"Everything is coming up {mh}"

# the troymcclure function expects a word to be passed to it
# if it is not given one, it assumes the default 3
def troymcclure(tm=3):
    if tm > 2:
        return f"2 minus {tm} equals negative fun!"
    else:
        return None

# tests MUST begin with the word test_ or they will be ignored
def test_homer():
    # assert will return true or raise an AssertionError
    # the primary application is debugging
    assert homer("doughnuts") == "You don't win friends with doughnuts"

# tests MUST begin with the word test_ or they will be ignored
def test_milhouse():
    # assert will return true or raise an AssertionError
    # the primary application is debugging
    assert milhouse("daffodils") == "Everything is coming up daffodils"

# tests MUST begin with the word test_ or they will be ignored
def test_troymcclure():
    assert troymcclure(5) == "2 minus 5 equals negative fun!"
    assert not troymcclure(1)

# testing a failure
def test_homer_fail():
    # This should produce a failure.
    assert homer("pretzels") == "You don't win friends with salad"
```
## <mark style="background: #ff9ed7;">tests MUST begin with the word</mark> `test_` or they will be ignored
- Now run pytest environment. Just typing `pytest` will run all the code in your current directory ending with `*.py`. If you want to target a single script, you can with the following usage.
```bash
pytest simpsons_test.py

pytest *.py #to run all code in the current directory
```
![[Pasted image 20230811151557.png]]

### Monkeypatch

Imagine we have some kind of python code that requires us to make a API lookup using the `requests` library. Perhaps that request calls an Amazon Web Services (AWS) API to build a VM or s3 bucket (object storage location). During testing we really don't want that to occur. We can stunt behaviors by creating fixtures and invoking pytest's ability to "**monkeypatch**".

- The **monkeypatch** fixture helps you to s**afely set/delete an attribute, dictionary item or environment variable, or to modify sys. path for importing during testing**.

- Create a fixture to control how the `request` library works when running a `pytest`. **Fixtures should be placed in `conftest.py` as this is the standard filename pytest searches for at runtime**.
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""Alta3 Research | controlling pytest behaviors with conftest.py"""

import pytest
import requests

# functions and methods are called callable as they can be called.
# in python a line preceded by an @ sign is called a "decorator"
# think of  a package wrapped in a gift...
# the decorator doesn't alter the code on the inside
# but can provide it with some additional functionality
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def disable_network_calls(monkeypatch):
    def stunted_get():
        # this is the error we want to raise if someone tries to call our target function
        raise RuntimeError("Network access not allowed during testing!")

    # creating a monkeypatch fixture will change the run behavior of any included functions
    # in the line below, the function to be altered is 'requests'
    # see https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/ for more on using the pytest suite
    monkeypatch.setattr(requests, "get", lambda *args, **kwargs: stunted_get())
```

- Here is a script that uses the request library
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""Alta3 Research | Script to interact with Astros API"""

import requests

def astros():
    r = requests.get("http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json")
    if r.status_code == 200:
        return r.json()
    else:
        return None

def main():
    print("Right now in space we have...")
    print(astros())

# This statement becomes critical if we are going to import our code into a test suite.
# Without it, main() would auto-execute when it was imported into the test suite.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

- Here is the testing file for pyest
```python
# import our code called isspace.py
import issspace
# import our pytest suite
import pytest

# our tests are now in a dedicated file
def test_astros():
    # request cannot perform sending an HTTP get
    # we cannot run this sort of test --> assert issspace.astros() == "Network access not allowed during testing!"
    # if we do, it will cause a runtime error to be thrown and pytest will crash
    # therefore we must tell pytest to expect a runtime error
    with pytest.raises(RuntimeError) as slappysquirrel:
        # telling pytest to run the astros() function within the file issspace.py
        # because it's nested in the with statement, pytest understands this will return a runtime error
        # However, rather than crashing pytest, pytest will keep running because it knows this is expected behavior
        issspace.astros()

    assert "Network access not allowed" in str(slappysquirrel.value)
    # here we are asserting that the slappysquirrel object created by pytest contains the string "Network access not allowed"
```

# Lab 41 - Docker SRATCH container
Images are the basis for containers. In this lab, we use some existing code as the basis for an image. Then, we turn it into a Docker Container.

**What is an image?** An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the Ubuntu image but installs the Apache web server and your application as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run.

You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others and published in a registry. To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image. When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have changed are rebuilt. This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small, and fast when compared to other virtualization technologies. For simplicity, you can think of an image as akin to a git repository - images can be committed with changes and have multiple versions. If you don't provide a specific version number, the client defaults to **latest**.

- We will use Go, to code the containers.
	- we are going to install GoLang. We want to show you how to create small, compact, minimal containers that load blazingly fast, which shortens testing and greatly reduces future security risks because we are about to create a container that only contains the executable code and nothing else. GoLang is perfect for this job, so let's get started.
	
- Create your hello world program. Cut and paste the ENTIRE code block below into your terminal. The 7-line code block runs as a single command. 
- The **`cat >>EOF`** portion of the command will start reading at the second line of the code block, ingesting all the lines until encountering an **EOF** string, which stops cat from reading in more content. 
- Then the **`> hello.go`** portion of the command saves the ingested content into a file called **hello.go**.
```go
cat <<EOF > hello.go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
EOF
```
```bash
go run hello.go
```


- You can build a Go module with the command, then compile
```
go mod init greeter

go build
```

- Now we will use a WONDERFUL feature in Go that will select the right go version to compile webby. Let's take advantage of that feature by turning it on.
```bash
export GO111MODULE="on"
```
- Now let's activate a Go feature that will track our code's dependencies (so that we don't have to). We'll call our go module the same name as our web server "webby" purely for clarity.
```
go mod init webby
```

- Next, let's install webby's dependencies. The go module we just created in the previous step will remember all of this.
```bash
go get -u github.com/stripe/stripe-go/v72

go get .
```

- Here is the moment you have been waiting for! You will create a binary that will run autonomously inside a docker container. This tiny extra step is the difference between creating a 1GB container loaded with garbage and future security threats vs. a 100 MB sterile container that just works. This is why we are using go for this lab! Let's compile webby. It will take about a minute.
```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o webserver .
```
**For your information, this is what the extra directives mean:**  
- **CGO_ENABLED=0** - Disable cgo to create a static binary  
- **GOOS=linux** - (GO Operating System) compiles the OS hooks INTO the binary  
- **-a** - flag means to rebuild all the packages we're using  
- **-installsuffix cgo** - Look for packages in $GOROOT/pkg/$GOOS_$GOARCH_cgo  
- **-o webserver** - Write compiled code to a file named `webserver`
![[Pasted image 20230811155236.png]]

- Now that we have an image compiled, we need to load it into a totally EMPTY container. In Docker, an empty container is called a "scratch" container. Study this diagram:
```
                       +------------>

```

- Use the Dockerfile you just created to create a lightweight image named **webby**:
```bash
sudo docker build -t webby -f Dockerfile .
```

# Lab 42 - Configuring Python Applications with Environment Variables
**Environment variables** have values which are set outside of a program, usually through the operating system or a microservice. Like other variables, they are made up of name/value pairs and are available for reference at any point in time. Environment variables are traditionally set in ALL CAPS.

In Linux, we can set environment variables from the command line with the "export" keyword. **In Python, we can make use of the _os_ package to set environment variables.**

- You can use the command below to see all variables currently defined on our environment
```bash
printenv
```

- set a new new env variable
```bash
export MY_VAR="Hello, world!"

echo $MY_VAR

- The tool we need from the os package is "environ", which does just what it sounds like it would: accesses our environment. We can pull variables out in the same way might access items in a dictionary. If `os.environ` were a dictionary, how would you set a key called "MY_VAR2" to the value of "Hello again, World!"? Put that line of code in your script.

- We have two ways to access our environment variables with the os package: `os.environ.get()` and `os.getenv()`. With both, you pass your variable name as a _string_ into the function as an argument. Both will return **None** if the variable is not set, 
- but `os.getenv()` can take a **second argument to specify a default value to use if the environment is not set**. Create two variables called "var1" and "var2", set them to the value of MY_VAR2 using the two methods just mentioned, then have them printed to the console.

- Example code using `os` to get and set environmental vars
```python
#!/usr/bin/env

import os

  

def main():

os.environ["MY_VAR2"] = "Hello again, World!"

  

var1 = os.environ.get("MY_VAR2")

var2 = os.getenv("MY_VAR2")

  

print(var1,var2)

  

var3 = os.getenv("ABSENT_ENV", "I'm defined!")

  

print(var3)

  

if __name__ == "__main__":

main()
```

### [Configuring Python Applications with Environment Variables](https://live.alta3.com/content/tlg-devops/labs/content/devops/python_env_vars.html#configuring-python-applications-with-environment-variables-1)

There are many Python applications that can be configured with environment variables. These variables can be set on the server running the application and accessed within the application code using the os.environ dictionary.

Let's use Flask as an example. Like many web frameworks, Flask uses environment variables to configure various settings. Here are some of the environment variables that can be used to configure Flask:

- `FLASK_APP`: This variable is used to specify the name of the Flask application file (e.g., `app.py`) or Python module that contains the application instance. Flask uses this variable to locate the application when it is started.
- `FLASK_ENV`: This variable is used to specify the environment in which Flask is running, such as `development`, `production`, or `testing`. The value of this variable affects the behavior of Flask in various ways, such as enabling debug mode or changing the log level.
- `FLASK_DEBUG`: This variable is used to enable or disable debug mode in Flask. If set to `1`, debug mode is enabled, which provides more detailed error messages and a debugger. If set to `0`, debug mode is disabled.
- `FLASK_RUN_HOST`: This variable is used to specify the hostname or IP address that Flask should bind to when it starts. By default, Flask binds to `localhost`, but you can use this variable to bind to a specific IP address or hostname.
- `FLASK_RUN_PORT`: This variable is used to specify the port that Flask should listen on when it starts. By default, Flask listens on port `5000`, but you can use this variable to specify a different port.
- `SECRET_KEY`: This variable is used to set the secret key for the Flask application. The secret key is used to encrypt session cookies and other sensitive data. You should always set a unique and secure secret key for your application.

```python
import os
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

app.config['DATABASE_URI'] = os.environ.get('MY_APP_DB_URI')
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.getenv('MY_APP_SECRET_KEY', 'This is my secret key!')

# Define a route for the home page
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return f"My Database URI is => {app.config.get('DATABASE_URI')}, and my Secret Key is => {app.config.get('SECRET_KEY')}"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run("0.0.0.0", 2224)
```
