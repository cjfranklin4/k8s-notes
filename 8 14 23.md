# Docker Compose
- `docker-compose.yaml`
```bash

```
- STOPS and REMOVES the current container
- but keeps the container
```bash

# Lab 45 - deploying a microservice using docker compose
```yaml
  version: '3.8'
  services:
    app:
      build:
        context: .
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
      ports:
        - 2224:5000
      depends_on:
        - db
    db:
      image: lscr.io/linuxserver/sqlitebrowser:latest
      volumes:
        - ./data:/data
```
- "`Depends_on`" mapped to "`db`" notes that the app is dependent on the database and ensures the database will be started before the app.
- Our second service is "`db`", which needs an image. This image is from Dockerhub. "Volumes" creates a volume binding between the `./data` directory on the host machine and the `./data` directory inside the container; this volume mount allows persistent storage of the database.

# Test Suite
- another file that tests your application (using pytest or unittest)

# Lab 47
### [Concepts Covered](https://live.alta3.com/content/tlg-devops/labs/content/devops/python_test_method.html#concepts-covered)

- _unittest_ module
- testing methods
- testing classes

- _unittest_ is a standard library tool that we can use for testing. Within unittest is a class called "`TestCase`" which will help us to generate tests. Within the TestCase class is a function called "`assertEqual()`" to check the equality of two valies, i.e. our assertion and what our script actually returns. We will create a subclass from unittest. TestCase, which will inherit that function/method.

- script with the unittest moduke
```python
import random
import unittest

class GreetingTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_create_greeting(self):
        result = create_greeting("Hello", "Someone")
        self.assertEqual(result, "Hello, Someone!")

def create_greeting(greeting, name):
    return greeting + "," + name + "!"

def main():
    greeting = random.choice(["Hello", "Howdy", "Yo", "What up"])
    name = input("What is your name? ")
    print(create_greeting(greeting, name))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    unittest.main()
```

- here is the seperate file with only the unittest ode
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""Testing File for greeting.py"""

import unittest
import greeting

class GreetingTest(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_create_greeting(self):
            result = greeting.create_greeting("Hello", "Anyone") # <= This time we need to access the function through the import with dot notation.
            self.assertEqual(result, "Hello, Anyone!")

if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
```

# Lab 49 0 test suites for Python APIs
A **test suite** is a grouping of tests organized as a cohesive unit, usually placed in a separate file from the production code. Using libraries such as _unittest_ (standard) and _pytest_ (third party), test suites are an important part of the development process. A good understanding of testing and how test suites work is essential in moving toward the production pipeline.

In this lab, we will create some test cases for a project you may have already worked on with Alta3 (we will provide the code here if you don't already have this locally).

There are a few central components of this project we should test. While there are a number of things we could test for, let's select two major components and test a function for each.

- Database Connection (SQLite): test the get_db_connection() function to verify that it establishes a connection to the SQLite database and returns a valid connection object.
- Subscriber Management: test the get_subscribers() function to confirm that it retrieves the list of subscribers from the database and returns the expected results.
```python
import unittest
import sqlite3
from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for
from email_reg import get_db_connection, get_subscribers, app
#app represents the whole flask application we built

#we will write our first test to check our database connection.
class DatabaseConnectionTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_get_db_connection(self):
        with app.app_context():
        #with the understanding that we are looking at the flask app we built
            conn = get_db_connection()
            self.assertIsInstance(conn, sqlite3.Connection)
            conn.close()

class SubscriberManagementTest(unittest.TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        with app.app_context():
            conn = get_db_connection()
            c = conn.cursor()
            c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS subscribers (email text)''')
            c.execute("DELETE FROM subscribers")  # Clear any existing data
            c.execute("INSERT INTO subscribers VALUES ('test1@example.com')")
            conn.commit()
            c.close()
            conn.close()

    def setUp(self):
        self.app = app.test_client()

    def test_get_subscribers(self):
        with app.app_context():
            subscribers = get_subscribers()
        self.assertEqual(len(subscribers), 1)
        self.assertEqual(subscribers[0]['email'], 'test1@example.com')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

# Lab 50 - fuzzing/fuzz testing
**fuzzing** or **fuzz testing** is an automated software testing method that injects "bad" inputs (invalid, malformed, or unexpected) into an application to reveal software defects and vulnerabilites. In the following lab, we will create a simple python application, then perform some "fuzz testing" on it. Sometimes, fuzz tests are created to generate some test cases we may not have been able to think of.

- here is a program that takes user input
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""Python Script for Fuzz Testing"""

def get_name():
    return input("What is your name?")

def get_age():
    return int(input("What is your age?"))

def process_name_age(name, age):
    if age > 0 and age < 110:
        return f"Hello, {name}. Your age is verified."
    else:
        return f"I'm sorry, {name}, but I cannot verify that age."

def main():
    print(process_name_age(get_name(),get_age()))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

- here is the fuxx testing script for the above program
```python
import unittest
import random
from greeting import process_name_age

#We will create a class called FuzzTest, which is actually a subclass of unittest.TestCase, a testing class from the unittest library.
class FuzzTest(unittest.TestCase):
	#Each of our tests is an instance method that we add to our class.
    def test_typical_inputs(self):
        typical_inputs = [
            ("Alice", 25),
            ("Bob", 50),
            ("Charlie", 18),
            ("Eve", 99)
        ]
        for name, age in typical_inputs:
            with self.subTest(name=name, age=age):
            #'subTest', a context manager within the test methods of unittest.Testcase,
                output = process_name_age(name, age)
                self.assertEqual(output, f"Hello, {name}. Your age is verified.")
                
#Our next test will check for some edge cases, thing outside of the bounds of what we would expect to receive. Our program is supposed to handle these inputs in a certain way, so this test is verifying that.
    def test_edge_cases(self):
        edge_cases = [
            ("", 25),  # Empty name
            ("John", 0),  # Minimum age
            ("Jane", 111),  # Maximum age
            ("Max", -5)  # Negative age
        ]
        for name, age in edge_cases:
            with self.subTest(name=name, age=age):
                output = process_name_age(name, age)
                self.assertEqual(output, f"I'm sorry, {name}, but I cannot verify that age.")

#This test will test random inputs for age.
    def test_random_age(self):
        for _ in range(5):  # Perform 5 fuzz tests
            name = "John"  # Use a fixed name for this test
            age = random.randint(-1000, 1000)
            with self.subTest(name=name, age=age):
                output = process_name_age(name, age)
                if age > 0 and age < 100:
                    self.assertEqual(output, f"Hello, {name}. Your age is verified.")
                else:
                    self.assertEqual(output, f"I'm sorry, {name}, but I cannot verify that age.")

# Run the test suite
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

# Lab 52 - Automate the setup between unit tests using parameterized data
With automated testing for containerized applications, often environment variables are the best way to inject test data into your application. In another lab, we covered setting environment variables, so this may already be a familiar concept.

**environment variable**: a dynamic value that is part of the environment in which a process or program runs. The value of environment variables are set _outside the program_.

In this lab, we make use of the _os_ package from the Python standard library, a package which allows us to access our local operating system, including getting and setting environment variables.

- Should be working now. But this is probably not the most efficient way to set our environment variables. One of the intentions of using Docker-compose is to streamline things and to keep us from having to work so much from the command line.
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
COPY requirements-test.txt .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements-test.txt

COPY . .

CMD [ "python", "main.py" ]
```

- DOcker-compose file
- This Docker Compose file defines two services: `myapp` and `test`. The `myapp` service builds and runs the Flask application with an environmental variable `MY_VARIABLE` set to `my_custom_value`. The `test` service builds and runs a test suite with an environmental variable `MY_VARIABLE` set to `my_test_value` and runs the `pytest` command.
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  myapp:
    build: .
    environment:
      - MY_VARIABLE=Alta3
    ports:
      - 2224:2224                   # our application was already set to run on 2224, so we can do the same within the container. The first 2224 is the port on our local host, so we can render to aux1
    depends_on:
      - test                        # lets our Docker Compose file know that we are waiting for some tests. 
  test:
    build: .
    environment:
      - MY_VARIABLE=my_test_value   # this is the "test value" for our variable. 
    command: pytest                 # we still need to create a test
```

- here is the test suite
```python
import os

def test_env_variable():
    my_variable = os.getenv('MY_VARIABLE')
    assert my_variable == 'my_test_value'           # This is what we are hoping that our Docker Compose file sets as the value of our environment variable. 
```
