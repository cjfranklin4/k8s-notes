# Lab 51 - Labels and Selectors
In this lab, we will be attaching labels to Pods and Deployments, and then using these labels to select Pods and Deployments.

Organization with Kubernetes can mean the difference between "Success!" and "Oh, no..."

Labels enable users to map their own organizational structures onto system objects in a loosely coupled fashion, without requiring clients to store these mappings. Objects, remember, are those things we are creating within Kubernetes. The pod "webby", for example, is a Pod object.

Because labels are searchable, they offer an obvious advantage when trying to identify similar builds (versions), apps, or purposes. In short, labeling allows for an easy search and view of objects you or your organization would like to link together.

Labels are just like social media hash-tags, but they include a "key:value" pair (displayed in the kubectl output as "key=value"). Both the "key" and the "value" are dynamic (you can set them however you wish). However, **do not ever expose secret information with labels**, such as passwords (i.e. `pass=qwerty123`) or even usernames. Stick to things like, "silo=5g-research" or "app=ng-controller".

Additionally, labels allow Kubernetes resources to be **selected** by other Kubernetes resources. For example, a ReplicaSet chooses which Pod(s) to maintain based upon the labels that the Pod(s) have placed on them.

- Let's take a quick look at what contexts are available to our kubectl client. Remember, a context is a reference to a cluster, namespace, and user.
```
kubectl config get-contexts
```

> Remember, a deployment is a higher-level concept than a "pod". A deployment is asking Kubernetes to manage pods, exposing features like "rolling updates", "rollbacks", and "replicas". In production, there is no doubt you'll use deployments. However, in testing (or when you're first learning), a more basic level on off pod is sufficient.

- Get the labels on every pod. Notice that NGINX has the label `what=what` currently.
```
kubectl get pods --show-labels --all-namespaces
```

- Get the version label of all pods with label `app`. The value of `app` is our key, which will be displayed as a new column. If there are any matches on this label, the value will appear in the column.
```
kubectl get pods -L app
```

- Looks like `nginx` does not have a key for the value `app`. Let's apply a new label to `nginx`. We'll assign the key `app` the value of `web_service`.
```
kubectl label pods nginx app=web_service
```

- Now we should also be able to update the manifest to accomplish this. Perform the following `get` command to get the running pod's manifest.
```
kubectl get pod nginx -o yaml > nginx-pod-update.yaml
```

## Label a Kubernetes Pod
> Kubernetes objects are integral parts of the system, but telling one from the other can be difficult. That is what labels and annotations are for! Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to objects- their purpose is to give meaning and relevance to the user. They also allow users to organize objects for greater efficiency. Labels can be added when objects are created but can be modified whenever you wish. These labels must have a unique key/value label in order to work.

- Create an NGINX deployment. Create the following `Deployment` manifest. Deployments are higher level than "Pods". A Deployment is controlled by Kubernetes, and allows for cool features like, image upgrades and rollbacks.
```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1 
kind: Deployment  # the type of resource to create
metadata:  # describes deployment itself
  name: nginx-obj-create  # name applied to the deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:   # matchLabels tell the deployment which Pods to associate with
      app: nginx   # this label MUST match the label found in spec.template.metadata.labels
  replicas: 3  # create this many replicated pods
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:  # every pod will have the following labels
        app: nginx  # pods are labeled app: nginx (match label matches on this)
    spec:
      containers:  # describes a list with only 1 container
      - name: nginx  # name of the container will be 'nginx'
        image: nginx:1.18.0  # image:version downloaded from hub.docker.com
        ports:   # port(s) to expose
        - containerPort: 80  # exposed port for this container
```

- Lets compare and contrast a pod vs a deployment
- List all of the pods. 
	- A **single stand alone pod will "only" have its name.** 
	- A **pod that is part of a deployment is also given a UUID trailer to uniquely identify the Pods as belonging to a replicated set**. This replication is handled by Kubernetes' Replication Controller.
```
NAME                                READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
nginx                               1/1       Running             0          9h
nginx-obj-create-6c54bd5869-8bqxt   1/1       Running             0          10m
nginx-obj-create-6c54bd5869-npj82   1/1       Running             0          10m
nginx-obj-create-6c54bd5869-tk424   1/1       Running             0          10m

```

- label a pod
```
kubectl label pods <FULLPODNAME> project=easy
```

- Show more than one label
```
kubectl get pods -L project,segment
```

- delete pods/deployment
```
kubectl delete -f ~/nginx-obj.yaml
```

## Remove Pod Labels
>Labels are VERY important when it comes to organizing your Kubernetes environment. When it comes to labels, searching for an issue could be the difference of _minutes_ (if you have labels) and _hours_ (if you don't have labels)! Nobody likes slow response times!

- Oh no! You added an incorrect label to a pod. Let's remove it now! FYI, the confirmation that the label has been removed isn't terribly helpful. It might be more accurate if their message simply indicated that a label change has occurred.
```
kubectl label pods nginx "project-"
```

## Apply, Modify, and Search for Labels
> Kubernetes was made to grow with you as your application scales both in size and complexity. With this in mind, labels and annotations were added as a foundational concept. Labels are key/value pairs that can be attached to Kubernetes objects such as Deploys, Pods and ReplicaSets. They can be arbitrary and are useful for attaching identifying information to Kubernetes Objects.

- label multiple pods in one command
```
kubectl label pods alpaca-prod bandicoot-prod "firewall=true"
```

- Label selectors are used to filter Kubernetes objects based on a set of labels. They are used both by end users (via tools like kubectl) and by different types of objects (such as how ReplicaSet relates to its pods). We showed all the labels of all our deployments in the last lab. Let's list deploys with a certain version now.

- Check out the `--selector` option associated with `kubectl get pods` (it can also be used with other `kubectl` commands). You'll find the following:
```
kubectl help get pods | less
```
```
-l, --selector='': Selector (label query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. -l key1=value1,key2=value2)
```

- Now use the `selector` to get the version or label we want.
```
kubectl get pods --selector=ver=2
```

- We can use the bang-equals `!=` to indicate exclusion. Let's find all pods not labeled staging.
```
kubectl get pods --selector=env!=staging
```

# Deployments - Purpose and Advantages
- a deployment is an object that creates a replicaset object
	- can update replicasets with zero downtime
	- allows for version control
- a replicaset creates as many replicas as needed
	- they do not care what node a pod is created on
	- recreates a pod when it is created
- 

- the first time you create a deploynents, the revision will start at version 1 (v1)
	- everychange increments the version history by 1,
	- so even if you go BACK on a change, it will be named the next revision change and DELETE the old version

# Lab 58 - Create and Configure a Deployment
### [Lab Objective](https://live.alta3.com/content/kubernetes/labs/content/kubernetes/deployments/Writing-a-Deployment-Manifest.html#lab-objective)

- Effortlessly delete Pods and Deployments with or without a manifest.
- Create a Deployment for webby.

Deployments are higher-level than ReplicaSets. Think of a deployment as a wrapper around a ReplicaSet. Therefore, just like a ReplicaSet, a deployment will ensure that there is a "correct" number of Pods available (that the deployed count matches `replica:`).

Deployments also allow for tracking revision history while performing rollouts or rollbacks. This is a feature that ReplicaSets by themselves lack.

For more reading on Kubernetes Deployments, check out: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)

**Name at least two ways to launch a pod.**

- _Use the command, "kubectl run"_
- _Create a manifest file and the command, "kubectl create -f " or "kubectl apply -f "_
    - _Create a kind: Pod_
    - _Create a kind: Deployment_
- _Looking ahead, we'll learn that using Helm is also a viable technique._

**What are the differences in the ways to launch a pod or Kubernetes object?**

- _Using a command at the CLI is fast, but work is not recorded_
- _Using a manifest is a way to easily record work with a version control software, like git and GitHub_
- _kind: Pod - launches a single pod_
- _kind: Deployment - launches 1 or more pods that may be replicated and updated with new images via a 'rollout'_
- _Using automation, like Helm, allows for rapid, predictable, continuous deployment of complete systems_

- Let's view a manifest for us that is already written. **You'll see it creates a Deployment for 'zombie' with a replica count of 3.**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1 # for versions before 1.9.0 use apps/v1beta2
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: zombie
  labels: 
    app: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 3 # tells deployment to run 3 pods matching the template
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.18.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

- if you try to `kubectl delete pod [deployment-pod-name]`, a replacement pod will be created instanky

- **DELETE USING THE SOURCE YAML** "The easiest way to delete an object is to reference the same YAML that made it in the first place. So this should work...":
```
kubectl delete -f ~/mycode/yaml/zombie.yaml
```

- Another way to delete a Deployment is to `get` a listing of the Deployments, then delete the Deployment by its name:
```
kubectl get deployment
```

- As it turns out, you may also **delete using a deployment name**. To delete the entire deployment, use the deployment keyword, like this:
```
kubectl delete deployment zombie
```

- Show the labels of the zombie deployment.
```
kubectl get deployment zombie --show-labels
```

- **DELETE WITH LABEL-** Delete the entire deployment like this:
```
kubectl delete deploy -l app=nginx
```

# Deployments Rollout
- by default, deployments use `RollingUpdate` strategy
- Recreate is best for TESTING

# Lab 60 - Performing Rolling Updates and Rollbacks
The objective of this lab is to learn to rollout and rollback deployments while observing best-practice skills (documenting your work with annotations). Within this lab you'll create a deployment of the 'zombie' image with a replica count of 3. Update the running image within the 'zombie' via a 'rollout.' Observe each of the pods within the deployment update in real time. Finally, rollback the deployment to the previous version.

- lets create a new deployment
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1 # for versions before 1.9.0 use apps/v1beta2
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: zombie
  labels: 
    app: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 3 # tells deployment to run 3 pods matching the template
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.18.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

- apply the deployment
```
kubectl apply -f zombie.yaml
```
- - **Why are there three zombie-yyyyyyyyyy-zzzzz pods?**
        - _Because a Deployment is made up of 1 or more pods. In this case replicas=3, so three identical pods are being deployed_
    - **Is there any reason zombie-yyyyyyyyyy-zzzzz is named the way it is?**
        - _Yes! All pods within a deployment are given this "double-hyphen" notation. Anytime you observe two-hyphens within a pod name, you can assume it is part of a deployment._
- /

- View the rollout history of a deployment
```
kubectl rollout history deploy zombie
```

- Set an annotation on the **CHANGE-CAUSE** field.
```
kubectl annotate deployment zombie kubernetes.io/change-cause="deployed ver. 1.18.0"
```
```
kubectl rollout history deploy zombie
```
```
deployment.apps/zombie
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1         deployed ver. 1.18.0
```

- Take a look inside one of your zombie pods to check the deployed version.
```
kubectl exec -it zombie-<replace-with-zombie-pod-id> -- bash

nginx -v
```

- Lets update the nginx image within the zombie deployment yaml file and reapply, watch the old containers take down and new ones be created

- **What happened?**
    - _Kubernetes created a new replica set containing a pod with the updated image. For each 'new pod' it created, it then terminated an 'old pod'. It repeated this process in a controlled manner until all the pods within the Deployment were running the new image._
- .

- Uh-oh. It looks like our **CHANGE-CAUSE** field didn't reset to `<none>`. That's because the `apply` command will compare the version of the configuration that you’re pushing with the previous version and apply the changes you’ve made, without overwriting any automated changes to properties you haven’t specified. More on how the apply operation works with updating Kubernetes resources is available here: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/#in-place-updates-of-resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/#in-place-updates-of-resources)

- Manually set an annotation on the **CHANGE-CAUSE** field. _NOTE: Setting this annotation could be part of an automated process_
```
kubectl annotate deployment zombie kubernetes.io/change-cause="ver. 1.19.6"
```

- Now apply that change and see what the below pane shows as your rollout is taking effect. _This time we'll include the_ `--record` _flag_ which should auto update our **CHANGE-CAUSE** field.
```
kubectl apply -f zombie.yaml --record
```

> STOP! Read this. On the CKA/CKAD exam, you will be asked to _**'Record the change.'**_ This is what they're looking for. However, as you will notice in this lab, the _**--record**_ flag has been deprecated. This mean that it is scheduled to be removed. It has been in this state for about 5 years, and no alternative has yet to be made available. Therefore, the _**--record**_ flag is the appropriate resolution for this task. If you would like to look at what a five year old, controversial GitHub ticket looks like, check out the incredible _**--record**_ drama unfolding on the Kubernetes GitHub. [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/40422](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/40422)

## ROLLBACKS
- Take a quick look at your rollout history details concerning, "Revision #1". The command you are about to issue is strictly informational (it will not make any changes).
```
kubectl rollout history deploy zombie --revision=1
```
```
deployment.apps/zombie with revision #1
Pod Template:
  Labels:       app=nginx
        pod-template-hash=5bf87f5f59
  Annotations:  kubernetes.io/change-cause: deployed ver. 1.18.0
  Containers:
   nginx:
    Image:      nginx:1.18.0
    Port:       80/TCP
    Host Port:  0/TCP
    Environment:        <none>
    Mounts:     <none>
  Volumes:      <none>        

```

- Now attempt to undo a rollout via a rollback. The 'undo' command undoes the most recent update.
```
kubectl rollout undo deploy/zombie
```

- The rollout status should also show that it was successful
```
kubectl rollout status deploy zombie
```

# Miniproject
https://github.com/csfeeser/devops/blob/main/k8s_miniproject.md

## Task 1
- get the yaml file from an already created pod
```
kubectl get pod nginx -o yaml > nginx-pod-update.yaml
```

- create a pod in a namespace
```
kubectl -apply -f [file] -n [namespace]
```

## Task 2
- can also use `kubectl run`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: singer
  namespace: talent
spec:
  containers:
  - name: opera
    image: nginx:1.7.9       
    ports:
