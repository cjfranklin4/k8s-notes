# [DevOps Final Project](https://live.alta3.com/content/tlg-devops/labs/content/devops/devops-project.html#devops-final-project)

For the last few days of class, you will have the opportunity to showcase the skills you've accumulated in your DevOps course! Working in small groups, you will plan, code, test, and deploy an application.

You will have class time to work with your assigned team and complete an application that meets your assigned topic.

## [Project Requirements](https://live.alta3.com/content/tlg-devops/labs/content/devops/devops-project.html#project-requirements)

- Project code is committed to a Git repository to which all team members have read/write access.
- Create a dynamic website using a **Flask server** and **Jinja2 templating.**
- The application must **take in some kind of user input** and **utilize that information in rendering a Jinja2 template.**
- You must include a _test suite_ with a minimum of three tests. You may use PyTest, Unittest, or any other library you prefer!
- The application must be _containerized_ and the image pushed to a Gitlab container registry.
- A container must be built from this image using any of the following technologies (CHOOSE ONE):
    - Docker-compose `docker-compose.yml` file
    - Kubernetes Pod
    - Terraform Module

You are permitted to use code from the labs and from AI! Think of an AI as an assistant or your own junior engineer. Practice how to give it specific instructions to produce some of your files.

## [Presentation Day](https://live.alta3.com/content/tlg-devops/labs/content/devops/devops-project.html#presentation-day)

You will be given an assigned time to present with your group members to an audience. Each group member is expected to have an equal share in presenting. Your presentation will include the following:

- A demonstration of your application
- An explanation of how the code works
- Each group member sharing what they learned
- Reflection on what the group might have done if they had more time
- Audience members may have other questions!

> PowerPoint is not required but may be a nice touch! Before you begin, revisit one of the first labs in this course, the 12 Factor App. You should have a better understanding of this methodology now, and it will help guide your process.

# Terraform hcl syntax
---

- ### [HashiCorp HCL:](https://live.alta3.com/content/terraform/labs/content/terraform/LECTURE_terraform_syntax.html#hashicorp-hcl)
    
    - Line comments begin with `//` or `#`
    - Multi-line Comments begins with `/*` and end with `*/`
    - Preference for `_` although `-` are supported
    - `string`: a sequence of Unicode characters representing some text, like "hello"
    - `number`: a numeric value. The number type can represent both whole numbers like `15` and fractional values like `6.283185`.
    - `bool`: a boolean value, either true or false. bool values can be used in conditional logic.
    - `tuple`: is created with `[` and closed with `]`. These are untyped. They may contain any any mix of types. Elements are identified by consecutive whole numbers, starting with zero.
    - `list`: is created by passing a `tuple` to the function `tolist()`. Unlike a `tuple`, `list` contains a single type. Elements are identified by consecutive whole numbers, starting with zero.
    - `set`: is created by passing a `tuple` to the function `toset()`. Unlike both the `tuple` and `list`, the `set`, has no sense of position. Therefore, operations must be performed across all elements of the set. Additionally, the `set` will not have any repeating values. Values within a `set` will be a single type.
    - `object`: is created with `{` and closed with `}`. Objects contain key/value pairs. Where keys are always strings, values may be any type. Objects _do not_ have any concept of position.
    - `map`: is created by passing an `object` to the function `tomap()`. Unlike an `object`, a `map` contains a single type. Maps _do not_ have any concept of position.
    - Strings, numbers, and bools are sometimes called primitive types.
    - Lists/tuples and maps/objects are sometimes called complex types, structural types, or collection types.
    - `null`: a value that represents absence or omission. If you set an argument of a resource to null, Terraform behaves as though you had completely omitted it — it will use the argument's default value if it has one, or raise an error if the argument is mandatory. null is most useful in conditional expressions, so you can dynamically omit an argument if a condition isn't met.
    - Terraform is written in Go programming language and shares many of the same best practice rules
- ### [Modules:](https://live.alta3.com/content/terraform/labs/content/terraform/LECTURE_terraform_syntax.html#modules)
    
    - A collection of Terraform code that can deploy Infrastructure as code.
    - Analogous to an Ansible playbook or one Ansible role.
    - Found in a single directory.
    - Modules can call other modules, like an Ansible playbook calling a role.
    - The Module's working code is written in blocks.
    - By convention, certain BLOCKS TYPES are placed in certain files.
    - The working code can be written on one giant ugly file if that is your preference!
    - A simple Terraform module is a few `.tf` files in a single directory, and looks like this:
```
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf

```

### [Blocks:](https://live.alta3.com/content/terraform/labs/content/terraform/LECTURE_terraform_syntax.html#blocks)
- Vocabulary you must master right now: BLOCK, TYPE, LABEL, BLOCK BODY
- Terraform code is written in a group of lines that forms a block, best learned by example.
- The general form of a block is as follows:
```
<TYPE> <LABEL> <LABELS> <...> {
 ---- <BLOCK BODY> -----
}
```

- This is a `terraform` block - It **informs Terraform how to start this terraform module**
	- informs of what version of the provider to use
```hcl
terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "organization-name"
    workspaces {
      name = "learn-terraform-module-use"
    }
   }
  required_providers {
   aws = {
    source  = "hashicorp/aws"
    version = "~> 4.4.0"
  }
}
required_version = ">= 1.1.0"
}

```

- A `provider` BLOCK - It **describes resource providers** like AWS, GCP, docker, time, etc
```hcl
provider "aws" {
region = "us-west-2"

default_tags {
  tags = {
    hashicorp-learn = "module-use"
    }
  }
}
```

- A `resource` BLOCK - **Defines specific details of a provider**
	- the second label identfies the docker image
```
resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
  image = docker_image.nginx.latest
  name  = "tutorial" # string of the docker image
  ports {
    internal = 80
    external = 8000
  }
}

```

- A `module` BLOCK - **Describes other modules that can be incorporated into this module** (Think Ansible role or include playbook)
```
module "vpc" {
source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
version = "3.14.0"
name = var.vpc_name
cidr = var.vpc_cidr
azs             = var.vpc_azs
private_subnets = var.vpc_private_subnets
public_subnets  = var.vpc_public_subnets
enable_nat_gateway = var.vpc_enable_nat_gateway
tags = var.vpc_tags
}

```

- A `variable block` - **Defines one variable** and its associated metadata
    
- Need 100 variables? Then write 100 variable blocks!
```
 variable "vpc_name" {
     description = "Name of VPC"
     type        = string
     default     = "example-vpc"
}

```

- An `output` BLOCK - **A way to discover variables that can only be known at deployment**, think IP address for a freshly booted VM.
```
output "vpc_public_subnets" {
description = "IDs of the VPC's public subnets"
value       = module.vpc.public_subnets
}

```

- An `argument` simply **assigns a value to a key**
```
image_id = "zork123"
```

- `meta-arguments` - Here are four arguments that may be found within a block and are supported by all terraform module blocks.
```terraform
some_block {
  count: n              # Creates multiple instances of a module from a single module block
                        # mutually exclusive with for_each
}   

some_block {
  for_each: <object>    # Creates multiple instances of a module from a single module block
                        # mutually exclusive with count
}   

some_block {
  providers <object >   # Passes provider configurations to a child module
}

some_block {
  depends_on: <object>  # Creates explicit dependencies between the entire module and the listed targets.
}
```

- A `.tf` file is a file suffix indicating that the file contains Terraform blocks.
    
- At the start of each lab, we will show the `.tf` files you will create.
```
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
```

# Running terraform
- terrforms executes ALL files in your current durectory
- terraform will execute and file that ends in `.tf`
- convention is the main file is `main.tf`
- 
# Lab 10  - Up and Running with terraform
- Build a working module in a `~/mycode/docker-tf/` directory
- Write a single `.tf` file called `main.tf`
- deploy infrastructure that listens on port 8000
- destroy the infrastructure listening on port 8000
- edit the `main.tf`
- re-deploy same infrastructure but now listens on port 2224
- Please note that no real infrastucture will be harmed in these actions.

**The objective of this lab is to introduce working with Terraform.** Terraform uses a proprietary language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). This language is stored in `*.tf` files (Terraform Format). In these files you can describe your infrastructure and set variables. These definitions of your infrastructure are called a configuration.

Instead using the Terraform syntax (`*.tf` files) you can write the Terraform configuration in JSON. In this case, the file ends with `*.tf.json`.

- main.tf
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
      version = "~> 2.22.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "docker" {}

resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
  name         = "nginx:1.19.6"
  keep_locally = true       // keep image after "destroy"
}

resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
  image = docker_image.nginx.image_id
  name  = "tutorial"
  ports {
    internal = 80
    external = 8000
  }
}

```

- Initialize the project which downloads a plugin that allows Terraform to interact with Docke
```
terraform init
```

- Determine what will be constructed with the `plan` command
```
terraform plan
```
```
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions
are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # docker_container.nginx will be created

    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

- Provision the NGINX server container with the `apply` command.
```
terraform apply
```

- Great! Let's see if our code resulted in some containers being deployed to Docker.
```
docker ps
```

- Uh oh! Looks like we made a mistake. We didn't want to deploy NGINX on port 8000. We meant to deploy on port 2224. Rename `main.tf` as `main.tf.old`. Terraform will consider all of the `*.tf` files as part of the _module_, but appending the `.old` extension should be enough of a cover that it will avoid detection.

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
      version = "~> 2.22.0"
    }
  }
}

  image = docker_image.nginx.image_id
  name  = "tutorial"
  ports {
    internal = 80
    external = 2224
  }
}

```

- run terraform plan and see what the upfated plan is
```
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions
are indicated with the following symbols:

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy
```

- One easy way to see if our configuration file is valid, is to use the `validate` command.
```
terraform validate
```

- Remove the infrastructure with the `destroy` command.
```
terraform destroy
```

# Terraform variables
- below is a variable block
```
 variable "vpc_name" {
     description = "Name of VPC"
     type        = string
     default     = "example-vpc"
}
```

- to use terraform variables in a module
```
var.var_name
```

- set the actual variable value
```
terraform plan -add var "key=value"
```

# Terraform output block
- cherry pick values to highlight/display at the end of the terraform output
- equal to print/console.log
```
output "vpc_public_subnets" {
description = "IDs of the VPC's public subnets"
value       = module.vpc.public_subnets
}

```

- to view your outputs
```
terraform output
```
# Lab 11 - terraform variables
**The objective of this lab is to learn about how terraform processes variables input from the user.** Variables are declared using a `variable` block (at a minimum this block will define to Terraform that the variable exists). Despite being declared within a `variable` block, they are referenced using the pattern `var.<variable name>`. Variables may also be initialized (given a value) from the `variable` block in which they are declared, and/or initialized at run-time (passed in from the CLI). Variables passed in this fasion always "win" precedence.

The Terraform CLI defines the following optional arguments for variable declarations:

- `default` - A default value which then makes the variable optional.
- `type` - This argument specifies what value types are accepted for the variable.
- `description` - This specifies the input variable's documentation.
- `validation` - A block to define validation rules, usually in addition to type constraints.
- `sensitive` - Limits Terraform UI output when the variable is used in configuration.
- `nullable` - Specify if the variable can be null within the module.

In this lab, you'll perform the following:

- Create a `vars-tf` root module
- Write a `main.tf`
- Add a `variables.tf` file (The main objective)
- Run the Module
- Create your own variable block as a challenge

- main.tf
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
      version = "~> 2.22.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "docker" {}

resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
  name         = "nginx:1.23.4"
  keep_locally = true    // keep image after "destroy"
}

resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
  image = docker_image.nginx.image_id
  # here we removed the name "tutorial" for the container
  # and replace it with a call to a variable
  # name  = "tutorial"
  name = var.container_name
  ports {
    internal = 80
    external = 2224
  }
}
```

- Create a variable file to define `var.container_name`. Terraform will read all of our `*.tf` files that are within our directory, so just be sure to use a clear name.
- define the variable cxontainer_name
```
variable "container_name" {
  description = "Value of the name for the Docker container"
  # basic types include string, number and bool
  type        = string
  default     = "ExampleNginxContainer"
}
```

- **Q: What is "type"?**
    - _A: The **type** argument in a variable block allows you to **restrict the type of value that will be accepted as the value for a variable**. If no type constraint is set then a value of any type is accepted. While type constraints are optional, it is recommend specifying them; they can serve as helpful reminders for users of the module, and they allow Terraform to return a helpful error message if the wrong type is used._
- **Q: What values may be passed for "type"?**
    - _A: Type constraints are created from a mixture of type keywords and type constructors. The supported type keywords are: string, number, and bool._
- **Q: What about Go (lang) complex types; lists, sets, maps, objects, tuples?**
    - _A: Constructors allow you to specify complex types. We can take a look at those later._
- .

- init the terraform and apply
```
terraform init

terraform apply
```

- view if the container has been created
```
docker ps
```

- Looks good. Run the `apply` command a second time, only this time, use the `-var` flag to provide a custom value for `container_name`
```
terraform apply -var "container_name=Valhalla"
```

- Check the container name again. It should have been updated to `Valhalla`
```
docker ps
```

- Suppose we wanted to ensure compliance with a pattern or constraint in regards to our input variables. Trash the current `main.tf`
```
# variables.tf - with validations
variable "container_name" {
  description = "Value of the name for the Docker container"
  type        = string
  default     = "ExampleNginxContainer"
  
  validation {
     condition     = length(var.container_name) > 8 && substr(var.container_name, 0, 7) == "Example"
     error_message = "The container_name must begin with Example"
  } 
}

variable "internal_port" {
  description = "Internal port of the container"
  type        = number
  default     = 80
}

variable "external_port" {
  description = "External port on the container"
  type        = number
  default     = 2224
}
```

- Try building with name that will **fail**
```
terraform apply -var "container_name=Odin" -var "external_port=24601"
```

# Lab 12 - Terraform Output Values with Docker

**The objective of this lab is to learn how and when to use output values.** Unlike variables in a variables.tf file which need to be referenced in the main.tf, output variables are _automatically_ printed when the module is run.

- SETTING UP DOCKER environment
- SETTING UP A `output-tf` MODULE DIRECTORY
- Write a main.tf
- Add a variables.tf file
- Add an outputs.tf file (The main objective)
- Run the Module
- Destroy the infrastructure

- main.tf
```
# main.tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
      version = "~> 2.22.0"
    }
  }
}
provider "docker" {}
resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
  name         = "nginx:1.23.4"
  keep_locally = true       // keep image after "destroy"
}
resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
  image = docker_image.nginx.image_id
  name  = var.container_name
  ports {
    internal = 80
    external = 8089
  }
}
```

- Create a variable file to define `var.container_name`. Terraform will read all of our `*.tf` files that are within our directory, so just be sure to use a clear name.
```
variable "container_name" {
  description = "Value of the name for the Docker container"
  # basic types include string, number and bool
  type    = string
  default = "ExampleNginxContainer"
  }
```

- Create a file named `outputs.tf`. This file will indicate the values we wish to learn about after our `apply` action.
```
# produces an output value named "container_id"
# this is the UUID terraform uses internally to track this resource
output "container_id" {
  description = "ID of the Docker container"
  value       = docker_container.nginx.id
}
# produces an output value named "image_id"
# this is the docker image identifier
output "image_id" {
  description = "ID of the Docker image"
  value       = docker_image.nginx.image_id
}
```

- **Q: Why use output values?**
    - _A: After we apply our configuration, we may wish to see or pass certain results; UUIDs for containers, virtual networks, users, and so on._
- **Q: What are some applications of output values?**
    - _A: The "root module" may use outputs can display information to users after a run finishes at the CLI, or as a JSON artifact (useful for passing to other automation systems). Outputs may also be used to pass information from a "child module" to a "parent module" (more on this coming up)._
- .

- init and apply the project
```
terraform init

terraform apply
```

- Near the end of the file you should see the values associated with `container_id` and `image_id`. However, we can request the values at any time using the `output` comma
```
terraform output
```

- Use the `show` command if you missed some outputs.
```
terraform show
```

- t is possible to query invidual output values with the `terrafomr output <output_name>` command
```
terraform output <output_name>
```

- Sometimes the next-in-line automation system may require outputs that are _easily_ understood. Try using the `-json` flag.
```
terraform output -json
```

- adding the tag `sensitive = true` in an output, prevents that output value from being displayed

- Stepping back from output values, and focusing on _project maintenance_ for a moment, it is possible to learn about the `providers` used by the project with the following command.
```
terraform providers
```

- The provider configuration shown on the screen may be placed in a "lock file" named `.terraform.lock.hcl`, which should be stored in the SCM along with your Terraform code. Where your code represents what Terraform should build, the lock file represents the versions of the providers Terraform should use to do the job. This file is created or updated every time you run `terraform init`. More on dependency installation behavior can be found here [https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/files/dependency-lock](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/files/dependency-lock)

- Remove the infrastructure with the `destroy` command. To avoid needing to type `yes` to proceed, use the `-auto-approve` flag. Other [apply options](https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands/apply#apply-options) also exist.
```
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

# terraform.tfstate
- has the currrent terraform state
- if tfstate and tfconfig match:
	- then everying you want to build already exists
- if you get rid of the state file, when you try to re-apply a container, (it forgets that it was previously created), you get an error bc it is trying to create a NEW container without etting rid of the previous version
- but tfstate files should be put in a secure location NOT in your environment

# Terraform CLI workspaces
### [Lab Objective](https://live.alta3.com/content/terraform/labs/content/terraform/LAB_terraform_workspaces.html#lab-objective)

**The objective of this lab is to learn about creating, using, and managing Terraform CLI workspaces.** Terraform starts with a single, default workspace named `default`. This workspace is forever, that is to say, it may not be deleted. If you're in a directory set up to run a Terraform solution, you are in a workspace.

**Workspaces offer separation**. For example, when you run `terraform plan` in a new workspace, Terraform does not access existing resources in other workspaces. These resources still physically exist, but you must switch workspaces to manage them.

**One of the best examples of using workspaces would be testing changes.** A workspace might be named after a branch, where each workspace offers a separation of state files. This would allow for workspaces such as `dev`, `prod` and `testing`. In all cases, all workspaces will always use the _same_ back-end (location where the state files are ultimately stored).

In general, the `terraform workspace` command takes the following form:
```
`terraform workspace <subcommand> [options] [args]`
```
**Resources:**

- [Terraform Workspace](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/workspace)
- [Terraform Workspaces - new](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/workspace/new)
- [Terraform Workspaces - list](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/workspace/list)
- [Terraform Workspaces - select](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/workspace/select)
- [Terraform Workspaces - delete](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/workspace/delete)
- [Terraform Workspaces - show](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/workspace/show)

- List the current workspaces.
```
terraform workspace list
```

- Only `default` is returned. The `*` shows this is the selected workspace. Create a new workspace.
```
terraform workspace new alta3_workspace
```

- Notice that when you created `alta3_workspace`, you also were moved to it. You may display _only_ the current workspace with the `show` command.
```
terraform workspace show
```

- Use the `select` command to return to the `default` workspace.
```
terraform workspace select default
```

- A workspace may be removed with the `delete` command.
```
terraform workspace delete alta3_workspace
```

- Now that we understand the command structure, let's try to create something simple in the `default` workspace.
```
# main.tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
      version = "~> 2.22.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "docker" {}

resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
  name         = "nginx:1.23.4"
  keep_locally = true    // keep image after "destroy"
}

resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
  image = docker_image.nginx.image_id
  # here we removed the name "tutorial" for the container
  # and replace it with a call to a variable
  # name  = "tutorial"
  name = var.container_name
  ports {
    # internal and external are now defined by variables
    internal = var.internal_port
    external = var.external_port
  }
}

```

- variables
```
# variables.tf
variable "container_name" {
  description = "Value of the name for the Docker container"
  type        = string
  default     = "ExampleNginxContainer"
}

variable "internal_port" {
  description = "Internal port of the container"
  type        = number
  default     = 80
}

variable "external_port" {
  description = "External port on the container"
  type        = number
  default     = 2224
}

```

- init and run the plan
```
terraform init

terraform plan -var "container_name=SNES" -var "external_port=11991"

terraform apply -var "container_name=SNES" -var "external_port=11991" -auto-approve
```

-  create a new workspace and try applaying the same commands as above

> The workspaces provide isolation of the state file. Without that state file, Terraform will not assume that it is "in control" of infrastructure just because names match. One way this could be useful is to use variables to build into different environments (_production_ versus _test_). We might also create a workspace named after a branch, and use that workspace and branch to test new ideas / changes before moving to _production_.

- One of the things workspaces can do for us, is prevent excessive downloads. We only have to run `terraform init` once, rather than on each lab, as we've been doing. That said, when you begin mixing workspaces with different git branches, things may get very confusing and tangled. Think of it like two remotes, and both need to have the correct `source` for anything to work. A good general rule of thumb, is don't use the `-force` command when you're trying to `terraform workspace delete`. Take the time to `terraform destroy` first.
