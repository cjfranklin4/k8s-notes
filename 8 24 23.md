# Lab 16 - Terraform Expressions and error

- This is one way to include variables/args within a terraform argument, using {} curly braces
```
name  = "nginx-${random_pet.nginx.id}-${count.index}"
```

**he objective of this lab is to introduce working expressions within Terraform.** If you've written any configuration files, you've likely used expressions and not realized it. Expressions are the logic center of the language. In short, expressions allow the retrieval of a value from somewhere, and may include a calculation or evaluation. That mean's it is a fairly extensive topic. So, we'll call out some of the more common expressions throughout this lab.

- we’ll look at the `random` and `time` providers for terraform

**Additional Resources:**

- random Provider - [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest)
	- allows the use of randomness within terraform configs like:
		- random number, random password, etc
- time Provider - [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/time/latest](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/time/latest)
	- 
- `count` - [https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/count](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/count)

- build a registry
- use `count` arg to make 4 containers. `count` returns an `index` to count each container
- the `name` is created based of the `count indx` and a `random_pet` name 
```
/* main.tf

# interact with docker
provider "docker" {}

# create random_ resources
provider "random" {}

# interact with time data
provider "time" {}

resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
  name         = "nginx:1.23.4"
  keep_locally = true
}

# available from random.random_pet
resource "random_pet" "nginx" {
  length = 2
}

resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
  count = 4 #make 4 containers
  image = docker_image.nginx.image_id
  name  = "nginx-${random_pet.nginx.id}-${count.index}" #random-name using an expression
  # name = "nginx-hoppy-frog-0"

  ports {
    internal = 80
    # 8000, 8001, 8002, 8003
    external = 8000 + count.index
  }
}
```

- **Q: How many docker containers are to be built?**
    - _A: Four (4). This is noted in the resource block docker_container.nginx._
- **Q: What is the provider "random" doing?**
    - _A: Think of providers kind of like a library. In this case, there's nothing to configure. It will just give us access to the "random_pet" resource._
- **Q: How would I learn about the random provider?**
    - _A: Read the documentation, https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs/resources/pet_
- **Q: What is random_pet.nginx.length doing?**
    - _A: Per the documentation this optional value defines the length of the randomly generated pet name (in words)._
- **Q: What is the ${} syntax near the end of the configuration?**
    - _A: This is an "interpolation", which is a way to provide a dynamic value. Interpolations are wrapped in ${}._
- **Q: What is the line, nginx-${random_pet.nginx.id}-${count.index} doing?**
    - _A: Generating a name that begins with a literal, "nginx-", followed by the random pet name, followed by a 0 or a 1._
- **Q: Where did count.index come from?**
    - _A: The "count" is a meta argument defined by the Terraform language. It accepts a whole number, and create that many instances of the resource or module. The count.index expression always begins at 0._
- **Q: Why do we have the time provider?**
    - _A: At this time we're not using it, but we will in an upcoming iteration._
- .

- create this output file
```hcl
## Output value definitions

# loop across all of the created instances docker_container.nginx (there are 4 of these)

# create an object containing "name" mapped to the container.name, as well as "host" mapped to the ip:external port


output "nginx_hosts" {
  value = [for container in docker_container.nginx : { name : container.name, host : "${container.ports[0].ip}:${container.ports[0].external}" }]
}
```

- versions file
```
/* versions.tf */

terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
      version = "~> 2.22.0"
    }

    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "~> 3.1.0"
    }

    time = {
      source  = "hashicorp/time"
      version = "~> 0.7.2"
    }
  }
}
```

- init and apply the terraform

- **Q: What did Terraform do first?**
    - _A: 1) Lock your project's state, so that no other instances of Terraform will attempt to modify your state or apply changes to your resources. If Terraform detects an existing lock file (.terraform.tfstate.lock.info), it will report an error and exit._
- **Q: What did Terraform do second?**
    - _A: 2) Create a plan, and wait for you to approve it. Alternatively, you can provide a saved speculative plan created with the terraform plan command, in which case Terraform will not prompt for approval._
- **Q: What was the third step?**
    - _A: 3) Execute the steps defined in the plan using the providers you installed when you initialized your configuration. Terraform executes steps in parallel when possible, and sequentially when one resource depends on another._
- **Q: There was a fourth step, what was it?**
    - _A: 4) Update your project's state file with a snapshot of the current state of your resources._
- **Q: Fifth step?**
    - _A: 5) Unlock the state file._
- **Q: And finally?**
    - _A: 6) Print out a report of the changes it made, as well as any output values defined in your configuration._
- .

- Now that Terraform has provisioned your containers, use curl to send an HTTP request to one of them.
```
curl $(terraform output -json nginx_hosts | jq -r '.[0].host')
```

- let’s create a new m ain.tf
```

# interact with docker

# create random_ resources
provider "random" {}

# interact with time data
provider "time" {}

resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
  name         = "nginx:1.23.4"
  keep_locally = true
}

# available from random.random_pet
resource "random_pet" "nginx" {
  length = 2
}

resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
  count = 4
  image = docker_image.nginx.image_id
  name  = "nginx-${random_pet.nginx.id}-${count.index}"
  # name = "nginx-hoppy-frog-0"

  ports {
    internal = 80
    # 8000, 8001, 8002, 8003
    external = 8000 + count.index
  }
}

resource "docker_image" "redis" {
  name         = "redis:7.0.11"
  keep_locally = true
}

#using the time_sleep resource to pause rhe module as it runs

resource "time_sleep" "wait_120_seconds" {
  depends_on = [docker_image.redis]

  create_duration = "120s"
}

resource "docker_container" "data" {
  # wait 120 seconds after downloading the image and launching the container
  depends_on = [time_sleep.wait_120_seconds]
  image      = docker_image.redis.image_id
  name       = "data"

  ports {
    internal = 6379
    external = 6379
  }
}
```

- **Let's see how Terraform responds to an error condition**. You'll need to work _relatively_ quickly on these next steps. You want to run the `apply` command, and then before the 120 second timer delay of downloading the image, and creating the container, we'll manually delete the downloaded image.

- An error will result. **Terraform isn't _great_ at handling errors (rolling things back). So if you get an error, you might (probably) have an undesirable state.** Common reasons for errors include changes to resources outside of Terraforms control, networking failures, API error (such as an rate limit or internal server error), or a bug in Terraform core.

- A **common sense place to start understanding an error, is to run the `show` command, which prints out Terraforms current understanding of your resources.** 
	- It **does not refresh the state, so it can be out of sync**. 
	- However, t**his command is safe, and non-service impacting**
```
terraform show
```
- then reapply

- ypical case use is to run an entire Terraform configuration. **However, there are times that we just want to replace a single resource (perhaps a single container was misconfigured and we want to replace "just" that single container).** 
- Get a list of the resources currently known about to Terraform.
```
terraform state list
```
```
docker_container.data
docker_container.nginx[0]
docker_container.nginx[1]
docker_container.nginx[2]
docker_container.nginx[3]
docker_image.nginx
docker_image.redis
random_pet.nginx
time_sleep.wait_120_seconds
```

- Replace the third docker container.
```
terraform apply -replace "docker_container.nginx[2]"
```

# Lab 21 - Dynamic provisioninf with tfvars
> Sometimes, you will r**equire the ability to assign a set of variables based on CONDITIONS.** This is where `tfvars` come into play. 
> 
> With tfvars you can create many `tfvars.tf` files **that define the same variables but each applies different values.** 
> 
> You **can then call a specific tfvars.tf file into play based on conditions**. Contrast this with normal vars which, like global variables, are universally defined

## variable precedence in terraform
-  `-var-file` > `tfvar` file > `-var` > `default` para
- `txt` files that list variable arguments to use
- you apply a txt file with `-var-file` option with `apply` (if it is a txt file
- tvfar automatically runs when you `terraform apply`

### environment variables in terraform
- you can grab env vars from the command line in yterraform
- but needs to start
```
expoer TV_VAR_[var name]=value
```

- create a new main.tf
```
# updated main.tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
      version = "~> 2.22.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "docker" {}

resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
  name         = "nginx:1.23.4"
  keep_locally = true
}

resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
  image = docker_image.nginx.image_id
  # here we removed the name "tutorial" for the container
  # and replace it with a call to a variable
  # name  = "tutorial"
  name = var.container_name
  ports {
    # internal and external are now defined by variables
    internal = var.internal_port
    external = var.external_port
  }
}
```

- Create a variable file to define `var.container_name`, `var.internal_port`, and `var.external_port`
```
# updated variables.tf
variable "container_name" {
  description = "Value of the name for the Docker container"
  type        = string
  default     = "ExampleNginxContainer"
}

variable "internal_port" {
  description = "Internal port of the container"
  type        = number
  default     = 80
}

variable "external_port" {
  description = "External port on the container"
  type        = number
  default     = 2224
}

```

- create a tvfars file
```
external_port = 2224

```

- Using this structure, it becomes easy to select which solution we want to deploy. Deploy the aux1 solution, using port 2224.
```
terraform apply -var-file="aux1/terraform.tfvars"
```

# Data block
- stores information in a `.tf` file
	- save information like API data
- they have their own sources (data sources)

# Lab 22 - Data Sources and HTTP Provider

> The HTTP provider offers _data sources_. Data sources are different from resources. Where resources offer ways to manage infrastructure object, **data sources provide access to data. They may still require input**. For example, the `http` data source requires _at least_ an `url` input. The URL may be either an http or https URL.  
> The read-only return data includes:
> 
> - `body` (String, Deprecated) - The response body returned as a string. NOTE: This is deprecated, use response_body instead.
> - `id` (String) - The ID of this resource.
> - `response_body` (String) - The response body returned as a string.
> - `response_headers` (Map of String) - A map of response header field names and values. Duplicate headers are concatenated according to RFC2616.
> - `status_code` (Number) - The HTTP response status code.

- Data Sources - [https://www.terraform.io/language/data-sources](https://www.terraform.io/language/data-sources)
- HTTP Provider - [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/http/latest/docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/http/latest/docs)

- create a provider file
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    http = {
      source = "hashicorp/http"
      version = "3.0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "http" {
  # Configuration options
}

```

-  creat emain.tf
```
# The following example shows how to issue an HTTP GET request supplying
# an optional request header.
data "http" "iss" {
  url = "http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json"      // API to send HTTP GET to

  # Optional request headers
  request_headers = {
    Accept = "application/json"
  }
}

```

- create an outputs file to print information about the data we collected
```
# produces an output value named "space_heroes"
output "space_heroes" {
  description = "API that documents folks in space"
  value       = data.http.iss.response_body
}

# produces legal JSON output value named "space_heroes_json"
output "space_heroes_json" {
  description = "API that documents folks in space"
  value       = jsondecode(data.http.iss.response_body)    // note the jsondecode()
}    
```

- init and apply

- view each specific output block
```
terraform output space_heroes_json

terraform output space_heroes
```

- The `-json` flag will also ensure your data is in a legal JSON format. This is especially useful in situations where your output will be part of some pipeline, and required in post processing _you should still use the jsondecode() function to ensure proper decoding._
```
terraform output -json
```

# Dynamic operations with functions
- use the terraform console
- All functions ingest **input** and produce **output**. The general syntax for function calls is the function name followed by _comma-separated arguments_ in parentheses:
```
function(x, y)
```
...where x and y are input values, such as strings or numbers.

- type
```
type(obj)
```

```
tolist()
```

- The result is a `map`, which is very much like an `object`, but containing a single type-- in this case, `string`. Use the `type()` function to show this.
- The `map` type can also contain numbers (or boolean) types. However, the keys will always be strings. Notice that the keys may or may not be quoted, as they will always be treated as `string` type.
```
tomap()

tomap({donatello = "machine", age = 15, "turtle" = true})
```

- Because a `set` does not have position, operations must be performed across the entire collection. For this reason, along with its highly typed nature, makes it a legal choice for using with looping operations. _Note: The_ `map` _also lacks any sense of order, and is highly typed. For this reason, you will learn that the_ `map` _is also a legal choice for looping operations._ Let's try to understand position a bit better.
```
toset([1,1,1,1,2,3,4,5,0,0,"cat","dog"])

```

- a tuple is an ordered sequence of objects - mixed types allowed, BUT you must turn a tuple INTO a list for it to be a list
-  a list is must be ALL OF ONE TYPE
- a set is an oredered sequence of objects, mixed types not allowed, no duplicates
- object is key value pairs
- map is key value pairs, key and value types must match, uses `=` instead of `:`
![[Pasted image 20230824150736.png]]

# for_each
can only use `for_each` with a map of strings or a set of strings

good for creating multple containers with different images
