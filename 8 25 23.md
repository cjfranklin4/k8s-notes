# Lab 24 - Looping Constructs and Null Resource
- Use the `for_each` in a block to repeat creating `null_resource` objects (an "empty" resource type)
- Learn new terraform CLI commands like `fmt` and `validate`
- Expand the set of strings to demonstrate how `for_each` will create additional resources.

**The objective of this lab is to introduce two keywords** `count` **and** `for_each` **looping constructs that may be used at the resource level.** Specifically we'll focus on two looping constructs:

- `count` - This is often brought up when talking about looping with Terraform as the `count` keyword existed before `for_each`. Supported at the _resource_ and _module_ level, however, _module_ level support was only added in version 0.13.
- `for_each` - Fully introduced in version 0.13, this technique is similar to the `count` but has some advantages. Generally, choose `for_each` over choosing `count`. This argument will iterate over a data structure to configure resources or modules with each item in turn. The `for_each` works best when the duplicate resources need to be configured differently but share the same lifecycle. Supported at the _resource_ and _module_ level.


- create main,tf, that has a `for_each` loop within it
```hcl
/* Alta3 Research - rzfeeser@alta3.com
   Working with "for_each" within a null_resource */

/* Terraform block */
terraform {
  required_providers {
    null = {
      source = "hashicorp/null"
      version = "3.1.1"
    }
  }
}

/* provider block */
provider "null" {
  # Configuration options
}

/* a list of local variables */
locals {
  avengers = ["the wasp", "ant man", "ironman", "captain america", "thor", "doctor strange", "spider man", "hulk", "black panther", "black widow"]
}


/* The null_resource implements the standard resource lifecycle but takes no more action */
resource "null_resource" "avengers" {
  for_each = toset(local.avengers)
  /* triggers allows specifying a random set of values that when
     changed will cause the resource to be replaced */
  triggers = {
    name = each.value  // a special variable, "each" created by terraform
                       // the object has "each.key" and "each.value"
  }
}

/* We want these outputs */
output "avengers" {
  value = null_resource.avengers
}
```

- To update our files for readability (usually spacing), use the `fmt` command. This command will return names of files it fixes. If it doesn't fix any files, it won't return any names.
```
terraform fmt
```

- If we want to made sure our files are syntactically valid, use the `validate` command. It should return a success message.
```
terraform validate
```

- here is the for each code by itself
```hcl
/* a list of local variables */

locals {
  avengers = ["the wasp", "ant man", "ironman", "captain america", "thor", "doctor strange", "spider man", "hulk", "black panther", "black widow"]
}


/* The null_resource implements the standard resource lifecycle but takes no more action */

resource "null_resource" "avengers" {
  for_each = toset(local.avengers)
  /* triggers allows specifying a random set of values that when
     changed will cause the resource to be replaced */
  triggers = {
    name = each.value  // a special variable, "each" created by terraform
                       // the object has "each.key" and "each.value"
  }
}
```

- here is what the output block looks like

# Lab 25 - Terraform local-exec
Say you wanted your Terraform module to perform a particular command on your system, such as sending output to a file. One way to accomplish this is to use a _provisioner block_ contained within the relevant resource block. **However, provisioner blocks are typically a last resort!** For more info, check out the [documentation on provisioners](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/provisioners/syntax). In this lab, we'll look at the `local-exec` provisioner, which invokes a local executable (i.e. a command on your local system) after a resource is created.
```
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  // ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    /* copy of the private IP(s) into a static file private_ips.txt
       on the target system */
    command = "echo ${aws_instance.web.private_ip} >> private_ips.txt"    
  }
}
```

The local-exec provisioner accepts the following parameters:
- **command** - _required_ - The command to execute. This can use a relative path to the current working directory or an absolute path. It is evaluated in a shell, therefore, wildcards (e.g., `>>`, `<<`, `&`, `!=`), environmental and terraform variables are all supported.
- **working_dir** - _optional_ - The directory to use as the working directory. This path must exist.
- **interpreter** - _optional_ - A list of arguments used to execute command, where the first argument is the interpreter itself.
- **environment** - _optional_ - block of key value pairs representing the environment of the executed command. inherits the current process environment.
- **when** - _optional_ - specifies when Terraform will execute the command. For example, when = destroy specifies that the provisioner will run when the associated resource is destroyed. Also see "Destroy-Time Provisioners" within the Terraform documentation for additional for details.
**Resources:**

- [Local-exec Provider](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/provisioners/local-exec)
- [Random Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs)
- [Null Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/null/latest/docs/resources/resource)

- n this first example of using the `local-exec` provisioner in terraform, we will use it to write a environment variableâ€™s value to disk. _The local-exec always runs on the machine executing Terraform_.
```
resource "null_resource" "this" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${var.owner} > file.txt"
  }
}

```

- We need to define our variable.
```
variable "owner" {}
```

- Set the value of the variable at runtime., this starts the creation of the file defined in the null resource and provisioner
```
terraform apply -var 'owner=rzfeeser' -auto-approve
```

- Suppose we wanted to generate a random password for a database, have it set, and then write the password that was created in the space where Terraform is running. Create a new directory.
```
resource "null_resource" "empty_space" {
    depends_on = [ random_password.password ]
    provisioner "local-exec" {
        command = <<EOT
            echo "db_password: '${random_password.password.result}'" > results.yml
        EOT
    }
}
```

- Create the following. If you want to read more about this resource, see [random_password](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs/resources/password)
```
resource "random_password" "password" {
  length = 16                      // required
  special = true                   // include special characters (defaults are: !@#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?)
  override_special = "_%@"         // supply your own list of specials (overrides default special list)
}

```

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    random = {
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "random" {}

```

- Set the value of the variable at run time.
```
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

Horoscope API w/ Jinja2 we wrote on Thursday- [https://github.com/csfeeser/pythondemos/tree/main/flaskdemo](https://github.com/csfeeser/pythondemos/tree/main/flaskdemo "https://github.com/csfeeser/pythondemos/tree/main/flaskdemo")

GitHub group lab from this morning- [https://github.com/csfeeser/devops/blob/main/setting_up_github.md](https://github.com/csfeeser/devops/blob/main/setting_up_github.md "https://github.com/csfeeser/devops/blob/main/setting_up_github.md")


GOALS:
- elect someone to make github repo and invite everyone else as collaborators
- before we leave, the final project repo should be cloned
	- everyone has their own branch
- start hashing out what the code is going to need to include to meet project requirements
- rough idea of who is going to do what
- .

### ideas
- flask
	- html - jinja2
- db - pokeapi
- pytest (for testing)

### idea
- toggle a desciprtion of the pokemon
	- location, personality, 
- /
