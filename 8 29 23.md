CHAD'S SUGGESTION FOR AN IDEAL PRESENTATION:  
~30 minutes!

• Introduce members of team and state what your app does.

• Drop the aux1 link in the chat and let your audience play while you demonstrate!  
   ○ Be sure to show off any error handling you've included!

• Take turns walking through the code and how it works.  
   ○ This includes Flask code, HTML, Dockerfile, and manifests  
   ○ Run your Pytest files!

• Pull up a Powerpoint with slides for each person that answers the following:  
  ○ what did you learn?  
  ○ what would you have done with the project if you had more time?
  - created 2 containers - one is what you go to to add more contant to inventory
  - another is the current pet shop application

- when first applied our depoly.yaml file, our pods kept getting a CrashLoopBackOff error

- when the pods are setting up, they are connecting to an empty persistent volume claim which has a subPath cart.db
	- but cart.db doesnt exists yet until we run main.py
	- so kubernetes created it as a directory instead of a file, which gave us an error
	- SO we need cart.db to already exist before the actual container is created
- `initContainer`
	- container that gets built before the main containers are created
	- is a temporary container, that we used to create cart.db
	- this int container will load up busybox (to do command)
	- mount the sqlite-storage PVC
	- have busybox, check if cart.db exists
	- then create the file cart.db (if it doesnt already exists)
	- then will turn off that container
	- this will help our actual containers set up, by creating cart.db ahead of time

- then we set up a port-forward 
	- (and tested with 2 pods from our replicaset)
- .
- Then open a port forward to at least 2 containers
	- one container is to add items to the cart
	- in the second container, double check if the items are inside the cart
- .

- explain that at the moment, everyone is writing to the same cart, so multiple people can’t play with it at the same time

- extended goals
	- use sessions in order to create login functionality AND individual carts per user who accesses the site
