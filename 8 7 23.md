Just a general question about the ping_router response:
```python
# if there were no errors with ping command, response = 0
    # if there WERE errors, response > 0
    if response == 0:
        return True

    else:
        return False
```
For the errorâ€™s returned numerical value, is there a standard number for this or is it random?

# Lab 50 - Introduction to ansible and playbooks
The objective of this lab is to understand the details surrounding the execution of an Ansible playbook. Running a playbook uses the **ansible-playbook** command, whereas running ad-hoc commands use the **ansible** command. Playbooks are way better for lots of reasons, not the least of which is that they can be version controlled. Best way to learn is to dive in, so Let's get started!

In this lab, we will perform the following tasks:

- Write an Ansible Playbook running the `apt` module to install `Figlet` on targetted hosts.
- Specify the Planetexpress inventory for our target hosts.
- Verify the application was installed successfully.
- Analyze the ansible output difference when target hosts are already in the proper state.
- Write an Ansible Playbook which would run the `apt` module to ensure `Figlet` is not installed.
- Verify the application was removed.
Documentation regarding building Ansible Playbooks can be found here:  
[https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html)

Another useful resource is the list of Ansible Keywords. Keywords are used to build playbook logic:  
[https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/playbooks_keywords.html](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/playbooks_keywords.html)

- The following playbook will let us SSH to the target machine, and leverage control of the aptitude tool (apt) via Python (the module takes care of this). All we need to do is pass a minimum number of arguments, and see that 'figlet' is installed (a program that lets us make banners).
```yaml
---
- name: Playbook - Install figlet    # metadata
  hosts: planetexpress:!farnsworth   # we want to take the planetexpress group and remove farnsworth
  connection: ssh     # default is to use the connection plugin ssh.py
  gather_facts: yes   # default is yes

  tasks:                                     # a list of what we want to do
  - name: using apt to install figlet        # metadata
    ansible.builtin.apt:                     # the module we want to run, apt.py
        name: figlet                         # parameter name has the value figlet
        state: present       # parameter state has the value present
    become: yes              # elevate status to admin, sudo, enable, etc.

```
- **What are the keywords being used here?**
    - _hosts, tasks, name, and become_
- **How did you know these were keywords?**
    - _Check the bookmark, then look at the keywords under **play** and **tasks**_

- The playbook runs against the group `planetexpress:!farnsworth` (all of `planetexpress` but no `farnsworth`). These labels are resolved in the inventory _Note: This inventory was installed by our setup script._
    `student@bchd:~$` `batcat ~/mycode/inv/dev/hosts`
    
- Ansible makes it easy to see what groups and hosts are within an inventory with the following command.
    `student@bchd:~$` `ansible-inventory -i ~/mycode/inv/dev/hosts --graph`

- Creates an ansible playbook that uses the `absent` state for `apt`
```yaml
---
- name: Playbook - Un-Install figlet
  hosts: planetexpress:!farnsworth   # remove farnsworth from the list of available hosts
  connection: ssh     # default is to use the connection plugin ssh.py
  gather_facts: yes   # default is yes

  tasks:
  - name: using apt to remove figlet
    ansible.builtin.apt:                 # this is the name of the module to use
        name: figlet
        state: absent    # this will REMOVE the application
    become: yes
```

# Ansible Inventory and config file
- ansible config file is where you can configure for the file to run with certain options
	- ex/ set default hosts file location
	- the ansible config file is location witin your home directory
	- `/home/student/.ansible.cfg`
.

# Lab 51 - Ansible Get Switch Config and Archive

This lab demonstrates how to retrieve a running configuration with Ansible and then save and archive it locally.

This lab will have you connect to virtual switches with SSH connectivity named `admin@sw-1` and `admin@sw-2`. If you find yourself unable to connect to the switches described within this lab, see the instructor.

- Store your inventory of target hosts in a `inv/dev/hosts` file. For example:
```yaml
[arista_switches]
sw-1
sw-2

[arista_switches:vars]
ansible_user=admin
ansible_network_os=eos
```

- an `ansible.cfg` file on your home directory


- ainsiblr playnook
```yaml
---
- name: Arista Config Saver
  hosts: arista_switches
  gather_facts: false
  connection: network_cli  # required to connect to most network devices (CLI over SSH)
  become: yes   # required to run the entire playbook as "enable"
  become_method: enable    # required when elevated status is something other than "sudo"

  vars:
    ansible_ssh_pass: alta3   # needs secured! This is a job for Ansible Vault (encryption tool)

  tasks:
  - name: Arista Fact Collection
    eos_facts:
      gather_subset: all  # IMPORTANT! Look at the return values at the bottom of the eos_facts

  # this will be executed on the CONTROLLER
  - name: Create Arista config save directory
    file:
      path: arista_config/   # this will be created on the CONTROLLER
      state: directory       # Playbook will FAIL without this directory

  # this will be executed on the CONTROLLER
  - name: Arista Config Save
    shell: "echo '{{ ansible_net_config }}' > arista_config/{{ inventory_hostname }}"

  # this will be executed on the CONTROLLER
  - name: Arista Archival Process
    archive:
      path: arista_config/{{ inventory_hostname }}  # Location of our archived file
      remove: False     # If True, removes the original file
```

# Lab 52 - Simplifying Network Playbooks with Agnostic Modules
his lab demonstrates how playbooks can be stream-lined by using the network agnostic modules. These modules are meant to work against most major vendors supported by Ansible. In all cases, the agnostic modules require the `network_cli` connection type to run.

At this time, those modules are:

The `cli_command` module:  
[https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/cli_command_module.html](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/cli_command_module.html)

The `cli_config` module:  
[https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/cli_config_module.html](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/cli_config_module.html)

Links to the latest information on Ansible Agnostic modules may be found here:  
[https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/index.html](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/index.html)

Curious if you should race out and rewrite your playbooks? Probably not. The first agnostic module was introduced in v2.7, another in v2.8, and we don't seem to see any development on new agnostic modules on v2.9. Moving forward, it's fine to use them, but Ansible does not appear to be in a race to deprecate old vendor specific modules.

The possible values of `ansible_network_os` can be found here:  
[https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/docs/docsite/rst/network/user_guide/platform_index.rst](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/docs/docsite/rst/network/user_guide/platform_index.rst)

This lab also demonstrates using **group variables**. When trying to organize your unique commands or secrets, you must stay organized. One way is with the inventory, another is with group variables, which are indirectly related to the inventory. To use group variable, first create a folder, `group_vars`. Inside this folder, you then create YAML files with the same name as groups found within your inventory.

- With some clever casting of group variables within our inventory, we were able to create a very simply playbook with the `cli_command`. No matter the vendor we run into, we'll always be returned a list of interfaces.
```yaml
---
- name: Network Commands by Vendor
  hosts: allvendors  # eosswitches is only active subgroup
  gather_facts: no
  vars_files:
    - ~/switch.creds

  tasks:
  - name: Run an agnostic command
    cli_command:
      command: "{{ commandtoshowinterfaces }}"
    register: results

  - name: show results
    debug:
            var: results

```

- Let's try writing another network agnostic playbook. This time we'll also explore the concept of **group variables**. Create a directory called `~/mycode/group_vars/`
```yaml
---
backup: "show running-config"
save: "copy running-config startup-config"
ntp_commands: "ntp server 0.us.pool.ntp.org"
ansible_become_method: enable
ansible_user: admin
ansible_ssh_pass: alta3

---
backup: "show running-config"
save: "write memory"
ntp_commands: "ntp server 0.us.pool.ntp.org"
ansible_become_method: enable
ansible_user: cisco_admin
ansible_ssh_pass: cisco_alta3
```
- We know that on an Arista EOS device and Cisco IOS, the command to get running config is `show running-config`, therefore both of our group_vars files have the same value for the variable `backup`. However the `save` commands are a bit different. An EOS expects `copy running-config startup-config`, whereas the IOS expects `write memory`. In the following playbooks, we can reference these different values that were set within the group_vars files. The secret, was naming the files the same as groups found within the inventory, `~/mycode/inv/dev/nethosts`.
```yaml
---
- name: backup all switch configs
  hosts: eosswitches:iosswitches   # these two groups
  gather_facts: false
  become: yes # run the entire playbook as enable
  connection: network_cli # required mode

  # no vars section but we have our
  # group vars that should be read into
  # our playbook along with our inventory

  tasks:

    - name: pull backup from switches
      cli_command:
        command: "{{backup}}"
      register: backup

    - name: ensure backup directory is created
      file:
        path: ~/mycode/backup/
        state: directory

    - name: write out the backup to a file
      copy:
        content: "{{backup.stdout}}"
        dest: "~/mycode/backup/{{inventory_hostname}}.backup"
```

- Now let's write a playbook that makes a change to the running configuration using the agnostic modules. This change will reference the `ntp_commands` var defined in our `/group_vars/` to update our switches as to the correct ntp server to use.
```yaml
---
- name: change switch configuration
  hosts: eosswitches:iosswitches   # these two groups
  gather_facts: false
  become: yes # run the entire playbook as enable
  connection: network_cli # required mode

  tasks:

    - name: load new NTP configuration
      cli_config:
        config: "{{ntp_commands}}"
      notify:
        - save and commit

  handlers:
    # handlers only run if a task runs that
    # notifies the handler to run
    - name: save and commit  # this name matches the notify
      cli_command:
        command: "{{save}}"
```
