# Lab 6 - The 12 factor application
he [12-factor app methodology](https://12factor.net/) was created by Adam Wiggins, who co-founded the cloud platform Heroku. He introduced the 12 factors in a blog post titled "The Twelve-Factor App" in 2011. The principles outlined in the post have since gained widespread adoption and have become a guiding framework for building "software-as-a-service" applications. The goal of the 12-factor app methodology is to provide developers with a set of best practices for building scalable, maintainable, and portable applications in the modern cloud computing era.

1. **Codebase**: One codebase is used for multiple deployments, promoting code reusability and reducing divergence between environments.
2. **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies, ensuring consistent and reproducible builds.
3. **Config**: Store configuration in the environment, separating configuration from code and allowing easy modification without redeployment.
4. **Backing services**: Treat backing services (databases, caches, queues, etc.) as attached resources that can be attached and detached without code changes.
5. **Build, release, run**: Strictly separate the build, release, and run stages to enable reproducibility, manageability, and scalability.
6. **Processes**: Execute the application as one or more stateless processes, enabling horizontal scalability and fault tolerance.
7. **Port binding**: Export services via a well-defined port binding mechanism, allowing applications to be accessed by other services.
8. **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model, running multiple instances of the application to handle varying workloads.
9. **Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown, enabling easy scaling, deployment, and fault recovery.
10. **Dev/prod parity**: Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible, reducing bugs and easing deployment.
11. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams, allowing applications to emit logs to stdout and enabling log aggregation and analysis.
12. **Admin processes**: Run administrative and maintenance tasks as one-off processes, separate from the application's normal runtime.
