# Lab 21 - Relational Databases
### [Lab Objectives](https://live.alta3.com/content/tlg-devops/labs/content/devops/relational_databases.html#lab-objectives)

- Understand how to create and join tables with SQLite
- Establish the relationships between classes/tables: i.e. one to one, many to many, one to many.

### [Concepts Covered](https://live.alta3.com/content/tlg-devops/labs/content/devops/relational_databases.html#concepts-covered)

- primary keys
- foreign keys
- join tables
- relational databases
- schema (still need to include an explanation for this)

In a relational database, or a type of database that provides access to related data points, tables can interact with and relate to each other as necessary. The kind of relationship we create between them relies on the relationship between those data points.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""J. Hutcheson | creating tables in SQLite"""

import sqlite3

# Create a connection to a new SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')

# Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands
c = conn.cursor()

# Create the companies table with columns for Company ID and Company Name
c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS companies
             (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
              name TEXT)''')

# Insert some example data into the companies table
c.execute("INSERT INTO companies (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Acme Inc.')")
c.execute("INSERT INTO companies (id, name) VALUES (2, 'XYZ Corp')")
c.execute("INSERT INTO companies (id, name) VALUES (3, 'Apple Inc.')")
c.execute("INSERT INTO companies (id, name) VALUES (4, 'Samsung Electronics')")
c.execute("INSERT INTO companies (id, name) VALUES (5, 'Toyota Motor Corporation')")
c.execute("INSERT INTO companies (id, name) VALUES (6, 'Google LLC')")

# Commit changes and close the connection
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

### Adding Foreign Key
 A script to accomplish this would look something like this:
 ```python
 #!/usr/bin/python3
 """J. Hutcheson | creating tables in SQLite"""

 import sqlite3

 # Create a connection to a new SQLite database
 conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')

 # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands
 c = conn.cursor()

 # Create the products table with columns for ID, Name, and Company ID
 c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products
              (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
               name TEXT,
               company_id INTEGER,
               FOREIGN KEY(company_id) REFERENCES companies(id))''')

 # Insert some example data into the products table
 c.execute("INSERT INTO products (id, name, company_id) VALUES (1, 'Widget', 4)")
 c.execute("INSERT INTO products (id, name, company_id) VALUES (2, 'Gizmo', 2)")
 c.execute("INSERT INTO products (id, name, company_id) VALUES (3, 'Thingamajig', 1)")
 c.execute("INSERT INTO products (id, name, company_id) VALUES (4, 'Doohickey', 3)")
 c.execute("INSERT INTO products (id, name, company_id) VALUES (5, 'Whatchamacallit', 6)")
 c.execute("INSERT INTO products (id, name, company_id) VALUES (6, 'Gadget', 5)")

 # Commit changes and close the connection
 conn.commit()
 conn.close()
 ```

## SQL Queries
```sqlite
# EXAMPLE ONLY
SELECT products.name                                       
# using dot notation, you can select an attribute such as "name"

FROM products                                              
# identifying the table we are looking for

INNER JOIN companies ON products.company_id = companies.id 
# looking for what "joins" the tables together, i.e. our foreight key of company_id

WHERE companies.name = 'XYZ Corp.';                        
# looking for the company_id that is associated with this specific company name
```
- Python script to accomplish the above is:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""J. Hutcheson | Retrieving table data with SQLite"""

import sqlite3

# Create a connection to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')

# Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands
c = conn.cursor()

# Execute the SQL query to find the product associated with "XYZ Corp"
c.execute('''SELECT products.name
             FROM products
             INNER JOIN companies ON products.company_id = companies.id
             WHERE companies.name = 'XYZ Corp';''')

# Fetch the results of the query
result = c.fetchone()

# Print the result
# print(result)
print(result[0]) # out results are returned to us in a tuple, uncomment out the above line if you'd like to see that.

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

## Challenge 2
```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to a new database (or open an existing one)
conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database2.db')

# Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands
c = conn.cursor()

# Create the companies table
c.execute('''
          CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS companies (
              id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
              name TEXT
          )
          ''')

# Insert some data into the companies table
c.execute('''
          INSERT INTO companies (id, name)
          VALUES (1, 'Acme Inc.')
          ''')
c.execute('''
          INSERT INTO companies (id, name)
          VALUES (2, 'XYZ Corp.')
          ''')

# Create the products table
c.execute('''
          CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
              id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
              name TEXT,
              company_id INTEGER REFERENCES companies(id)
          )
          ''')

# Insert some data into the products table
c.execute('''
          INSERT INTO products (id, name, company_id)
          VALUES (1, 'Widget', 1)
          ''')
c.execute('''
          INSERT INTO products (id, name, company_id)
          VALUES (2, 'Gizmo', 2)
          ''')
c.execute('''
          INSERT INTO products (id, name, company_id)
          VALUES (3, 'Thingamajig', 1)
          ''')
c.execute('''
          INSERT INTO products (id, name, company_id)
          VALUES (4, 'Doohickey', 2)
          ''')
c.execute('''
          INSERT INTO products (id, name, company_id)
          VALUES (5, 'Whatchamacallit', 1)
          ''')
c.execute('''
          INSERT INTO products (id, name, company_id)
          VALUES (6, 'Gadget', 2)
          ''')
c.execute('''
          INSERT INTO products (id, name, company_id)
          VALUES (7, 'Gizmometer', 2)
          ''')
c.execute('''
          INSERT INTO products (id, name, company_id)
          VALUES (8, 'Doohickey 2', 1)
          ''')
c.execute('''
          INSERT INTO products (id, name, company_id)
          VALUES (9, 'Thingamajig 2', 1)
          ''')
c.execute('''
          INSERT INTO products (id, name, company_id)
          VALUES (10, 'Widget Pro', 1)
          ''')

# Commit the changes and close the connection
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```


## One to One
## Challenge 3
Now, write a Python script to query all the products supplied by XYZ Corp.
```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database2.db')

# Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands
c = conn.cursor()

# Query all products that XYZ Corp provides
c.execute('''
          SELECT name
          FROM products
          WHERE company_id = (
              SELECT id
              FROM companies
              WHERE name = 'XYZ Corp.'
          )
          ''')

# Fetch the results and print them
results = c.fetchall()
for row in results:
    print(row[0])

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

## Many to many - JOIN tables
Think for a moment about the above tables. How do we relate each student to the classes they are taking? We can't just use the primary key in one table for the foreign key in another because each item in each table needs several foreign keys, essentially.

In a case such as this, we employ the use of a third table, often called a **join table**, which h**olds a primary key for each of the other tables for every connection between the two**. For example, we may have another table called "student_courses" which does this type of thing for us. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">NOTE: It is a common convention to name a join table based on the two tables it joins; this makes it easy for other developers to understand what's going on behind the scenes</mark>.
```python
import sqlite3

# Create a connection to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database3.db')

# Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands
c = conn.cursor()

# Create the students table
c.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT NOT NULL
    )
''')

# Insert some data into the students table
students = [
    (1, 'Alice'),
    (2, 'Bob'),
    (3, 'Charlie'),
    (4, 'Dave'),
    (5, 'Eve'),
    (6, 'Frank'),
    (7, 'Grace'),
    (8, 'Harry'),
    (9, 'Irene'),
    (10, 'Jack'),
    (11, 'Karen'),
    (12, 'Larry'),
    (13, 'Maggie'),
    (14, 'Nancy'),
    (15, 'Oscar')
]
c.executemany('INSERT INTO students VALUES (?, ?)', students) # <= this is new! Take a look at this command to see what it's doing differently than the script above.

# Create the courses table
c.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS courses (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT NOT NULL
    )
''')

# Insert some data into the courses table
courses = [
    (1, 'Introduction to Programming'),
    (2, 'Database Management'),
    (3, 'Web Development')
]
c.executemany('INSERT INTO courses VALUES (?, ?)', courses) # <= just like the line above, this command is inserting 'many' records into our table.
                                                            # This approach *potentially* makes our script more dynamic should we need to add courses
                                                            # here or add students above.

# THIS IS NEW! Create the student_courses table
c.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS student_courses (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        student_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
        course_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
        registration_number TEXT NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students (id),
        FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses (id)
    )
''')

# Insert some data into the student_courses table.
c.executemany('INSERT INTO student_courses (student_id, course_id, registration_number) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', [
    (1, 1, 'registration0101'),
    (1, 2, 'registration0102'),
    (2, 1, 'registration0103'),
    (2, 3, 'registration0104'),
    (3, 2, 'registration0105'),
    (3, 3, 'registration0106'),
    (4, 1, 'registration0107'),
    (4, 3, 'registration0108'),
    (5, 2, 'registration0109'),
    (5, 3, 'registration0110'),
    (6, 1, 'registration0111'),
    (6, 2, 'registration0112'),
    (7, 2, 'registration0113'),
    (7, 3, 'registration0114'),
    (8, 1, 'registration0115'),
    (8, 3, 'registration0116'),
    (9, 1, 'registration0117'),
    (9, 2, 'registration0118'),
    (10, 1, 'registration0119'),
    (10, 3, 'registration0120'),
    (11, 1, 'registration0121'),
    (11, 2, 'registration0122'),
    (12, 2, 'registration0123'),
    (12, 3, 'registration0124'),
    (13, 1, 'registration0125'),
    (13, 3, 'registration0126'),
    (14, 2, 'registration0127'),
    (14, 3, 'registration0128'),
    (15, 1, 'registration0129'),
    (15, 2, 'registration0130')
])

conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

- a script to query a student and find what classes they are taking is:
```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database3.db')

c = conn.cursor()

student_name = 'Alice'

c.execute('''
    SELECT courses.name
    FROM courses
    JOIN student_courses ON courses.id = student_courses.course_id
    JOIN students ON students.id = student_courses.student_id
    WHERE students.name = ?''', (student_name,))

courses = c.fetchall()
print(f"{student_name} is taking the following courses:")
for course in courses:
    print(course[0])

conn.close()
```
- To summarize the SQL code above (passed as an argument into c.execute()) in plain English: "
	- Find the `name` column in our `courses` table; 
	- **make a connection between the ID** on the `courses` table and the `course_id` on the `student_courses` table; 
	- **make a connection between the ID** on the `students` table and the `student_id` on the `student_courses` table; 
	- return the results from the `students` table where the name matches the string provided."
- .

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sqlite3

  

conn = sqlite3.connect('my_db.db')

c = conn.cursor()

  

#Shopping List Table

shopping = [

(1, 'Flour'),

(2, 'Butter'),

(2, 'Olive Oil'),

(3, 'Onions'),

(4, 'Bell Peppers'),

(5, 'Black Pepper'),

(6, 'Squash')

# proxy vs webserver
- reverse proxy – anon for your web server. 
	- good for security, you dont want your client accessing your server dirctly
	- can load balance incoming erquests to various servers

# Nginx config file
An NGINX configuration file is used to define how the NGINX web server should handle incoming HTTP requests. The file typically contains a series of directives that specify settings such as the server's listening port, the location of the server's root directory, and how the server should handle different types of HTTP requests.

### [Concepts Covered](https://live.alta3.com/content/tlg-devops/labs/content/devops/nginx-config-file.html#concepts-covered)

- **Directives**: the building blocks of an NGINX configuration file; specify how the server should behave when handling different types of requests.
- **Contexts**: groupings of directives which determine where the directives apply.
- **Virtual Servers**: (also known as a virtual host) a feature of web servers that allows multiple domain names to be hosted on a single physical server
- **Locations**: a directive to define how to handle requests for a specific URL path.
- **Variables**: (we know this one!) NGINX supports variables that can be used to dynamically generate configuration settings.

- Example:
```nginx
user nginx;
worker_processes auto;

error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;
pid /run/nginx.pid;

events { #curly braces is a context
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type application/octet-stream;

    log_format main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                    '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                    '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log main;

    sendfile on;
    keepalive_timeout 65;

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;
        root /var/www/example.com/html;

        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
    }
}


```

### Context and directive Syntax
```nginx
context {
    directive;
    directive;
    directive;
}

```

# Nginx server blocks
In an NGINX config file, you will encounter **server blocks** which define the settings and behavior for a specific virtual server. A server block may contain some of, but not limited to, the following parameters:

- The server name or IP address that the server block should respond to
- The port number to listen on
- SSL certificate settings for HTTPS connections
- Proxy settings for reverse proxying requests to other servers or applications
- Caching settings for improving performance
- Logging settings for monitoring server activity
First, let's have a look at an example of an NGINX configuration file with multiple server blocks.

Notice the data appears to be very structured. An NGINX configuration file is typically written in plain text using a simple and human-readable format that organizes the data into a hierarchical structure. The specific format is known as the NGINX Configuration Language.
```nginx
# This is a comment

# Server block for www.example.com
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name www.example.com;
    root /var/www/example.com;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}

# Server block for api.example.com
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name api.example.com;
    root /var/www/api.example.com;
    index index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }
}

# Server block for blog.example.com
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name blog.example.com;
    root /var/www/blog.example.com;
    index index.html index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }
}
```

- How a basic .conf file can look
```nginx
server {
    listen 2224;
    server_name _;
    
    location / {
    root /var/www/html;
    index index.html; #<= This line is new; we still need to create this!
    }
    
    location /flask1 {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9001; #<= remember from above that this is where our Flask1 server is running.
    }
}
```
